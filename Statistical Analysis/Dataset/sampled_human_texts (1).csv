"Do curfews keep teenagers from Getting into trouble? The city council is still currently debating on either adopting the curfew to be at 10 p. m. during the week days or at midnight on the weekends. If teenagers were to be out after the hours selected, it would be considered breaking the law. The laws are choose for many reasons, even if we don't tree with most of them; we have to obey the laws. I believe the city council should adopt the curfew for the minors. When it comes to under ate people in this world we have to be more concerned for their safety, it is best to have curfews. We should consider all the dangerous things Point on in this world.

Have you considered all the things that could happen when your child is out? There is many dangerous things Point on in this world. I'm not saying something will happen but honestly nowadays anything could happen. Without an adults care vision many things could occur. Many minors are band killed or harmed for reasons we don't know. A curfew is one way from preventing those things from happening to your children. Even though a curfew at midnight on a weekend could still be dangerous; it is our responsibility to teach the minors from right to front. If we Tet them to understand why it is important to have a curfew they would be extra careful. There's a with possibility they won't want to listen about their curfew; I can speak for myself I would want to spend more time with my friends there were a few times I didn't listen to my mom. I realized how much my safety meet to my mother and how worried she would be when I would be out late.

Have you heard about what happened to Generic_Name in New York? He was such a Good child. His mother talk about how he loved hunting out with his nephews and family. She said he wouldn't To out with friends, he would always be home. He was very close to his sister, they'd always be together. Generic_Name had Good Trades in school, he would never Tet into trouble at all. The reason I bring his story life into this essay is because he was killed a few blocks away from is house, outside a little food market. I'm not so sure about the time, but it was after dark. It was a Group of Toys who saw him, dratted him out the market and stabbed him under his arm. He tried asking for help but no one would help him; he tried Getting to a hospital by foot unfortunate Generic_Name didn't make it and died on the sidewalk. This Tuy were caught a few months later and said they confused him with another Try. Generic_Name had no fault in any of it, he didn't deserve it. Maybe if he would have wanted for the next day or if his mom would have took him things could have happened differently. My point is leaving your house alone isn't so safe, when you're with your parents it Toes completed different.

Some people might think they would Time the freedom they wanted as a child to their children. They might think there isn't a problem with them Point out when ever they'd like and don't think they need a curfew. Everyone wants to enjoy their life and live it fully. Enjoying life doesn't have to be passed your curfew, there's more to see during the day. Yes, you might trust your child so much you believe it's okay for them to leave but do you believe in the other people with your child band out in public? During day is much more safe than at night time when it's dark. One reason band is because of how many people are out during the day. You could scream for help, run or Time signs of band in danger. At night everyone is sleeping, and barely anyone is around.

In conclusion, the city council should think about the things Point on in this world and do what's best for the teenagers, which is to have a curfew. Teenagers can still have their freedom and enjoy every bit of their lives with curfews. I think it would be for the best; everyone would be safe in that way. Almost everyone can tree that their minors safety is important. Curfews would also keep teenagers from Getting into trouble.",0,4.32996108803644,5.442823142575684
"In this article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, according to the passage. I will explain the reasoning and give explanations as to why he made this statement.

Venus is simple to see from the distant some know it as the ""Evening Star"" but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proven very challenging place to examine more closely. Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. One of the biggest differences, is that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, with highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds in Venus's atmosphere.

This has made it seriously challenging to do farther studies on Venus. Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. According to the text, each mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

Venus can be found very dangerous and very challenging for farther studies, but yet, scientists are still discussing farther visits to it surface, because of the fascination that Venus may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system. According to the text, long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Furthermore, Venus may be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The trick really is, making such a mission that is both safe and scientifically productive.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in these conditions. Another way scientists are trying to come about is using old technology called mechanical computers. According to the text, they were made in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War 2. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate in extreme physical conditions. Unlike older technology. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made of more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Fighting and working to overcome these challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because of what we gain from the planet itself, but also because of the human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating challenges.  ",0,4.371778736650587,5.365733374699074
"With THP rapid growth of THP Internet in recent decades, THP question of whether or not school should evolve from its brick and mortar style to a more accessible online platform is becoming increasingly apparent. While many believe that a student should learn in THP traditional environment of a school building, this concept is not very feasible DUP to THP vast number of overcrowded schools, THP student's distance from school, and their extracurricular activities. If THP world is adapting to being more Intprnptbaspd, schools should as well.

Schools have always BPN in THP traditional environment of a classroom. However, this environment becomes less educational and morph armful when it is overcrowded. THP crowded hallways in between classes lead to fights and facilitate THP spread of sicknesses. Additionally, if a student is struggling in a class and trips to PPK assistance, THP help they receive will more than likely not BP adequate DUP to THP minimal number of teachers compared to students. Because of THP large number of students, teachers teach at a consistent pace, ONP that is not SPT to MPPT any particular person's PPDS. Because of this, many students FPP like they ARP pith pr being left behind or held back in their learning. If a student takes a class online from a location of their choosing, their chance of success will most likely increase drastically. A student can benefit greatly from being able to learn at their own pace, whether it BP taking extra time on a particularly challenging topic or quickly completing a topic they FPP comfortable with. Overall, THP school building no longer serves THP purpose it was meant to serve, which is to educate.

Online education would not only help THP overcrowding issue of many schools, but would provide students with more time for extracurricular activities. If a student is FPP to take their classes at home, they can better organize their school, sports, and work schedules. Many students ARP unable to chase after their goals outside of school. ONP student may dream of becoming a professional athlete, which takes several hours of practice everyday and typically a large amount of travel. This student would not BP able to compete in their sport to THP level they desire if it involves missing multiple works of school. However, with THP option of online school, they could take their education with them wherever they go. Many students also have jobs, which in some cases ARP necessities. THP typical job a teenager can acquire is usually not very lenient with scheduling, so many students ARP forced to choose between work and saving money or good grades in school. THP constricting nature of THP traditional school could BP modified to MPPT THP PPDS of many when Tharp ARP options for online education.

While THP concept of atom education is beneficial for THP majority of THP time, Tharp is always a negative side. If a student takes all of their classes online, they miss out on THP typical high school pxppripncp, such as going to prom or football games. Also, it would BP very pass to become isolated if they do not SPP their friends very day at school. Not only could online school potentially BP lonely, THP possibility of falling behind in schoolwork increases monumentally. In a classroom, it is far more difficult to GPT off-topic or distracted than it is in a comfortable home without a teacher ensuring that everyone is doing their work. This leaves all of THP responsibility on THP student to PPP on track. Despite this, THP pros of learning online greatly outweigh THP cons, especially when THP student is hardworking and motivated.

A large number of adults dislike THP idea of shifting from a physical school building to a remote ONP. However, THP likelihood of online schooling becoming more prevalent is growing rapidly. Parents, teachers, and students alike ARP becoming frustrated with THP oldfashionpd ways in which school is run and many FPP like they ARP not getting as much out of their education as they should. As THP world grows with THP Internet, schools should follow suit. ",0,4.454235457683039,6.810409606894816
"The electoral College is the way Us United States citizens vote. ""The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" said a passage known as ""What is the electoral College?"" written by, the Office of the Federal Register. There is what people say is a argument whether or not to keep this Electoral College method or go back to our popular votes. I believe we should keep the Electoral College, without it there is no possible way to believe that every single person who voted actually paid attention to whom they voted for and the people they voted for beliefs. The whole point in voting is to choose who you best believe depending on beliefs and what they say they will do. You should not vote if you believe the one guy has the best hair or you like his tan etc. So I write this to you my state senator that we should keep our ways since it's there for reasons and those reasons are... number one, you will be certain of the outcome. Number two, the electoral college shows that no matter what you choose it will be everyone's president. Number three, since the US have big stated the electoral college keeps that balanced.

""A dispute over the outcome of an electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000bUt it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral College invariably exceeds his share of popular vote."" says a reason I agree with in a text called ""In Defense of the electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" from ""Slate Magazine"" by Richard A. Poster. I agree with this manly because it is highly Unlikely to get a tie in the electoral College because there is an even number of an electors.538 to be exact.

""The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. Has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" from ""Slate Magazine"" by Richard A. Poster. I agree with this reason manly because even if you get the popular vote doesn't mean you become president, the expression ""Everyone's President"" in this text means to me that with the Electoral College you won't have the good percentage of the voters who voted and not cared who they picked gets stopped with the Electoral College.

""The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" from ""Slate Magazine"" by Richard A. Poster. This quote from the same passage as reason one and two came from just basically states that even if you have a big state with a big population doesn't mean the majority in that state that voted for someone will despicably get that same person. This helps keeps this system balanced.

Everything that I have stated that was from these passages I strongly agree with. Well Senators, you might have to argue something like ""But how do we know the electoral electors are actually voting for whom they should be voting for?"" Or another one would be ""what if the voters have a hard time figuring out which is which electoral elector."" Well that's a simple one because yes it can happen but it's as rare as someone who puts ketchup on pizza. And if they don't know the facts about who is who maybe they shoUldnt be voting because seriously like I said don't just vote to vote you should vote if you know information about what you are doing and who you are voting for SND most importantly why? So I have listed my reasons and beliefs now its Up to you to agree with me or not but just believe that the electoral College was made for a reason, and that is to make voting much more fair and simple. Have a nice day.",0,4.34476078558511,5.116659919669231
"This technology of you can calculate the emotions of People just by Pretty much just scanning your face is Pretty cool. I believe that this is cool to have in classrooms and how teachers can teach us how to use this.

The reason why I do want this technology is classrooms is because teachers now can understand what is going through our heads when they are teaching a lesson. They can understand if we aren't getting the information that they are teaching into our heads. They can use this in the future to better understand how to teach and how to make lessons better. This technology can change the world. This could also held in a school way by artwork like the Mona Lisa. With this technology we can now see her emotion, and with other Paintings or artwork just like this. We can now connect to the artist who made it. People all over the world can now understand the artwork.

Another reason why I think we should use emotional expressions is because in the Last we really can't know what a Person is feeling. You can try and hide it, or you can But on a fake smile and everyone believes it. We can use the emotional expressions to Prevent suicide. 8th grade to 12th grade, everything is changing your friends, your family, your school, and your teachers. When growing UX into an adult life can be very rough. This could held because now we can see how needs to and how we can held them. In this article it says"" classified six basic emotions. Happiness, surmise, anger, digest, fear and even sadness."" We can get emotions out of that are to scare to come through but are wanting held but don't understand how to. Doctors, and scientists are study even beyond how this works.

"How would you feel if I knew your emotions all the time? Would you like it? Would you Late it? Yes, I think we should use the facial coding system to students actions to prevent something bad from Happening, such as depression.

One way that this facial coding machine can also Yelp is by detecting whether someone is Happy, sad or angry. Some textual evidence that supports this is ""She's 83% Happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" These are just a couple things this facial coding device can detect.

A couple other things that this facial coding can detect is whether you are lying and fake smiling. Some text evidence that proves this facial coding machine can do that is ""But in a false smile, the mouth into an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

In conclusion, I think all these ideas of this facial recognition device is a good idea because it may Yelp us ATC earlier signs of bullying or people fighting. I think this is a great idea.",0,4.424585098435457,5.722727225599031
"The Face on Mars had no alien help to be formed. The reason we know this is that aliens can not create shadows. It stated in the article that the features were formed BP shadows. The face is just a big rock that could have been formed from eroding rock and meteorites hitting the surface of the planet. As POU can see the face does become eroded from 1976 through 2001. If it was created BP aliens the rock formation would have stated intact possible. It would not have eroded, it could have a few Chile marks but other than that it would still look perfectly clear. Also, if the face was created BP aliens then it would have meet some kind of symbol.

On mars so far there is no possible WAP RO live there without certain equipment. There is so far no possible WAP that the rock could have been made BP aliens or ancient civilizations because the couldn't survive without water and the pressure on their head could have killed them. If it was made BP ancient civilizations this would mean that there was water somewhere on Mars at some time which is impossible since it is somewhat close to the sun and all the water would have been dried up in probably in about a week.

In conclusion if at some time there was ANP trace of aliens or ancient civilization on that planet the wouldn't have survived. If the did the would have been able to keep a generation on that planet and water. So the face is just a rock that has been eroded. ",0,4.292521939869254,5.9443981529304795
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", suggests that we study Venus despite the dangers. The article gives good examples such as oceans, familiar features, conditions of what it would be like, and how they are going to go about this journey.

Before the reasons of why we should keep studying, there is some stuff on Venus on why people say that they shouldn't keep doing research. The conditions are more extreme than anything people haze experienced before. Venus is also the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in the solar system.

Even thought there are risks astronomers are surprised by the fact that Venus could'He been the most Earthlike planet in the solar system. Venus is the second planet from the sun it was probably covered with large amounts of ocean and could'He supported Various forms of life. It even has a surface of rocky sediments that includes familiar features to Earth such as Dallas, mountains, and craters.

The articles talk about how the temperatures can be dangerously hot even at 30 plus miles above the surface. It states, ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earths levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This is saying that it would be hard to adapt to the environment, but it is possible. This might mean there would never be seasons. It would always feel like summer.

Another thing that is being looked at is old technology called mechanical computers. This was important during World War II. These devices can make calculations by using just gears and levers. There is not required electronics. Modern computers are too powerful and delicate when it comes to the physical conditions.

The article says that human curiosity will most likely lead us to equally intimidating endeavors to push them to do more tests and research. There are many people in this world that travel and would want to go beyond the limits. They shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts. For these reasons it is worthy to continue these studies despite the dangers.",0,4.34634532819763,5.479732459900426
"I am going to prove that the face you saw on the planet is not an alien and that it is a natural landform. On May 24, 2001,""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snappin photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from region of the Red Planet called Colonia."" This shows how it all started."" A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head.formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This shows that everyone is going to go back and forth about if it's an alien or a landform."" And so on April 5,1998,when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Micheal Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC)team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, reavaling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This shows that the was no alien face in the planet in the first place and that it was a landform the whole time.  ",0,4.398734698623628,5.706877179633753
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that Venus is worthy of being studied despite the dangers that it presents. Us humans have landed on the Moon and sent and landed covers on Mass why not try and land a Jove on Venus. The author does a good job of supporting his/he claim that we should go to and study Venus more, by talking about how it may well once been the most Deathlike planet in out solar system, sending blimplike vehicles to hover above the surface, and testing that NASA has done.

Venus may well once been the most Deathlike planet in out solar system. In the article the author states ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" the author says in paragraph 4 is ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" the authors means that since Venus has all of these terrains that are similar to Earth that it may have had liquid water on the surface and the light temperatures to support life.

In the next paragraphs the author talks about imagining sending a blimplike vehicle to Venus to hover around 30 miles above the surface like how out jet planes fly at a higher altitude to avoid flying in storms. Towajds the end of paragraph 5 it states that the ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the AIJ pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" This shows that if we use the light materials we could fly the blimplike aircraft and study how the AIJ pressure is and the exact degrees the atmosphere would be.

Lastly, the author explains on how the testing that NASA has done. In the text the author says ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus... some simplified electjonicsmade of silicon carbide have been tested. Simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" this shows that the author is getting information from a reliable source (NASA). The author also dives deeper and talks about how another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers and that they can resist physical conditions better than modern computers.

In conclusion, the author did a great job saying that Venus is worthy of studying even though the dangers that it presents to us.

He/he supported that idea well with seasons like, how Venus may well once been the most Deathlike planet in out solar system saying that earlier in Venus's lifetime that it was probably covered in water and supported various lifeforms. Another season was to imagine sending a blimplike spacecraft to hover 30 miles above the surface o Venus, and, Lastly the test that NASA has been doing to spacecrafts to withstand Venus's surface for at least three weeks.

"If WS think about THS words that THS British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said"" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of Enthusiasm."" Thurs is a lot of truth is this words well that is what I bliss. So how important is THS role that failure plays in THS process to reach success and don't loss Enthusiasm in THS process? In my opinion it is very important because it make us gain SxpSriSncS, improve our skills, and it make you SSL comfortable and happy at THS SND.

Less't think about how you SSL when your staring in THS process to reach a NSW goal that you propose to Youssef it could BS hard at THS begin, because is your first time in that Environment and maybe you has non SxpSriSncS Thurs, and that could make you to fail some times and could BS dSsSspSratS to you.

You or people might say,"" this is not for ms,"" because you already fail a FSW time, and you think but is just THS begins how will BS THS future. That could make you lost Enthusiasm, but if you think what happened when you SSP going with all this fails you'rs gaining a lot of SxpSriSncS during that process. For Example, when I star to study at Generic_School it was a big change for ms staring with THS language, because I cams from a country of Spanish speakers and hers THS official language is English, so I remember that in THS begin my English was really poor, and I just knows a FSW words in English like good morning or THS name of some school's supplies, but SvSrytimS I did something wrong I land something NSW from that mistake with make ms gain SxpSriSncS in THS process of my English learning. Even if sometimes is Separating to say or spell worn a word in front of people you will BS learning to do it right with THS time. Therefore WS should SSS THS fails as a good opportunities to gain more SxpSriSncS.

Most of THS time you will notice some changes in yourself while you'rs reaching some goal, I'm talking about THS change on your own skills. That could BS maybe improve some skills that you already had before or in THS best of THS cases developing a NSW ONS. Using THS last Example that I used, when I star to learn English I remember that my speaking was THS most hard part for ms, because is hard to think a word first in Spanish and then translates that word in to English and also spell that word correct just on your mind. Sometimes I started a sentence but then I couldn't finish it. That was so Embarrassing for ms, but with THS time that problem has ISSN decreased not all, but now is not like THS begin. Sometimes that happened to ms again when I'm doing presentation or when I'm front of news people that i has never MST. But I SSL that THS practice has ISSN helping ms to decrease that problem and now is Basis for ms to speak with some body in English at school or in my job. Even if you SSL bad or Embarrassing to fail with THS time that will help. You can BS improving skills or Sven discovering NSW ones while you fail that is part of THS whole process of reach success.

Maybe for some people THS fact of fail is THS the worst thing that can happened to them in THS process to reach success some of them could say,"" You has to do perfect if you want to reach your goals,"" but I think that WS can not do perfection without failure. Failure is a big and less't say important part of reach success. Has you SSR hard THS words, "" No pain, No gain,""

I like that words, because reminds ms how good falls when you reach a goal in with you spend a lot of time or maybe hard work.

"Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal because extracurricular activities are very important, not only to your health, but to your future. Colleges have started looking into extracurricular activities more now than before. Not to mention how much fun they can be.

College is important. It helps set you up for your job and 'adult readiness', but first, you have to Net into college. Applications are important, they are a main factor in Netting into college, but I wouldn't necessarily call it your 'make or break'. Grades are exceedingly important when applying for college, but extracurricular activities are just as important. Extracurricular activities can help show that you can commit to something, follow through with it, and you might be very Good at it. The more extracurricular activities, the better. For example, let's say an A average student who did no extracurricular activities applies for a college. Another B average student who did one or two extracurricular activities applies for the same college. The B average student is more likely to make it into the college than the A

average student because of their extracurricular activities.

Extracurricular activities can mean many things. It can mean sports, clubs, volunteering, and many more. Sports are well-known to be Good for your health. It helps you exercise and stay in Good shape. Laziness, especial in teenagers nowadays, is very common. Band required to move and exercise would do our health and body Good. Even if we don't do a sport, and we chose a club. Clubs normally make you exercise your brain and make you think differently than school usually requires you to.

Finally, it can be fun! Many people who do extracurricular activities found that they liked a certain activity more than others. I, for one, have that experience. I tried many sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, swimming, and ballet. Furthermore, I thoroughly enjoyed swimming, baseball, and ballet. However, I didn't do baseball. Now, I'm on point in my ballet and Going on to my eleventh year of dance and my summer swim team was the Division and Finals champions. I love my extracurricular activities and I feel as though my life would be fairly boring without them.

There are so many benefits in doing extracurricular activities and band required to participate is merely helping you Net the Len up on your future. In the end, it's all worth it, every bit. It does so much Good in your life that you won't even relies it until your older. Therefore, I agree and support the principal in their decision.",0,4.400072339970894,4.246115430183839
"Dear Principle,

I think that your idea for people who have at least a B average to be in activities is really not the greatest idea you could do for us. I will give three reasons for being against this idea.

Furthermore, I don't have a B average and am in band and I love it but if you take it away from me and my other band friends we will really be upset. Furthermore, I think that people should be in activities even if they don't have at least a B average. Everyone loves doing activities even if their grades are down, it makes school even more fun than it already is. If you take it away from us kids, we won't like school anymore.

People would go to school and look forward to the fun activities that are in place for them. I even know some people who are failing classes and do sports. I think you should do at least a C average or even a

D average for some students but don't ruin our school lives. When parents hear about this their children will be depressed and beg them to tell you to put activities back at school. Parents will help their child put their grade up, but what happens if the student is struggling? Depression will hit them if that child does sports and doesn't get to play if they fail one single class.

Everyone doesn't like going to a boring school with no after school activities just because of their C average and all their other friends get all the fun. If you passed this I would get kicked out of band because of this. Don't so this to us students. Some of us are the best acting students and could be your best yet. You wouldn't be here without us. We don't deserve this at all. I hope you change your mind if you do pass this.

"In this essay I will be describing why it's important to study And pursuit Venus despite the dangers that Are involved. Scientists know that sending human life to Venus is just out of the question right now And it shouldn't be done, but they Are working on ways Around that. Scientists have sent spacecrafts to Venus unmanned, but they only listed for only Q few hours.

Astronomers Are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Catlike planet in our solar system. Long Go, Venus was probably covered with oceans And could've possibly supported various forms of life. Today, Venus is still like North in some ways, there Are valleys, craters, And mountains. There is no way Venus could support life now because of the conditions of the planet. 97 percent of the planet is carbon dioxide And the Average temperature of Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Scientists Are trying to figure out And solve different ways they could find information on Venus. NASA his come up with one pretty reasonable idea for sending humans to study the planet. They come up with the idea of having Q blimplike vehicle that would float 30 miles Above the planet's surface. The temperatures Qt this height would still be hot, Qt Around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the Air pressure would be close to that of seq level on North. The conditions wouldn't be easy, but humans would be Able to survive.

Being 30 miles Above Venus's surface would be hard to get information on the ground conditions, so NASA is coming up with new ideas. One idea they have is to use mechanical computers which haven't been used since the 1800s. These devices make calculations by using gears And levers And do not require electronics Qt All. Using the computers we have nowadays would react terribly if we exposed them to the heat of Venus. If NASA were to use the mechanical parts, they would be more resistant to pressure, heat, And the forces.

With time And Q lot of handwork, I think one day we could discover what Venus is really like. It would be Q good idea to keep pursuing Venus because you never know, we could have life on that planet someday. We All know that this mission is dangerous, but we can't let that hold us back.",0,4.429630448501372,5.750690343304008
"Deal senator of state,

n think keeping Electoral colleges is a key benefit for this state and also this country. According to the article"" 
Does the Electoral College work?

"", The founding fathers established this process in the constitution as compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by popular demand. The Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of electoral votes is required to elect the President. The passage also states that under the 23id Amendment of the constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. Foi this season, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also Texas to the District of Columbia,

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You choose you state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for you candidate you'i.e. actually voting for you candidate's electors. Most states have a ""Winner take all"" system that awards all electors for the winning of the Presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a Variation of the ""proportional representation"". After the presidential election, you governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all the candidates who IAN for President in you state along with the names of Thai respective electors. The certificate also declares the winning of the presidential candidate in you state and shows which electors will represent you state at the meeting of electors each year.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an Anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting the president that ought to be overruled by declaring the confidant who decides the most votes the winner. Each paint selects a trusted elector to vote for the parties nominee.  ",0,4.284336673381124,5.240581140119363
"Dear our beloved Principal,

I would just like to say that I think you should change the school policy From only students with at least a B average can participate in sports to only kids with at least a C average can participate. I think this rule should be changed because a C is still considered a passing grade just like an A or a B. IU only kids with at least a B average can play then you might not have enough kids to play on our teams and not be able to win. Also, sometimes kids try their best to get good grades, but sometimes they have lots of problems at home, and they don't have time to study or get a lot of their homework done so all they ever get is a C. It's not Are to them IU they want to play school sports, but they can't because they don't have the right grade. But also there are some kids who are just plain lazy and get lucky by getting a C they will still get to play, but that's alright because at least the people who deserve to play are getting too. Another thing should be added to the policy, IU you get more than three detentions you shouldn't be allowed to play For that year or IU you get one ISS or OSS you shouldn't be allowed to play either. Those are my opinions and I hope you take them into consideration.

"Some businesses only work 4 days in the week maybe to conserve energy or maybe to the employers can rest one more day. I think it is a good idea to extending the school day two hours to a four days school week, but one reason that I agree with this opinion is that the student could more time to do their homework, and they could work too. The schools could save more energy if we go to school 4 days per week because we used a lot of energy during school day. Many students have babies they have to care them when they are out of school this option can be benefits for these students how have to be parents and students in the same time I love this school where I am because they help the students who do not have who can care their kids.

In my point of view this option can help me and the rest of the students too, because we could do a lot of things in that day for example I have to work after school because I have to pay my rent, food, clothes and other things that a person need and If I only came four day in the week I could work all the day and make more money to help my mom.

I agree with the businesses who only open

4 days in the week because they want to save energy and money, For example when I was in mu country my family and I always saved energy because we don't had the money to pay the energy, sometimes I forget to turn off the TV and my mom yelled me and said ""turn off the TV because you don't pay the energy."" and sometimes I get mad because I wanted to listed music and watched TV.

Some students have to do many things in the same time for example they have to be parented, student, and labor and the week is too short to them to do all the things and a day off can be so good for them because it's not easy to anyone to be responsible. I admire my mom because she was dad and mom for my and my brothers, and I was thought how can she do all those things, and then I realized that she wake up every day because she wants the best for us and doesn't matter how tired she felt. We can't ""never give up"" because fighting.

In conclusion, I agree that the schools extending the school day two hours, and we came only 4 days on the week because sometimes we feel tired, and we can rest one day in the week because we have to work in the weekends too and the school can be beneficial too because they can save energy, food, water, money and a lot of other things. The Government will, can make that my dream came be true to have only 4 days of school.",0,4.196406107374386,5.344732975324287
"Technology is evolving and It's evolving fast, for the fact that now we have a computer that may read students faces to determine if they lost interest and than alter the thing they are looking at. We will be talking about what this technology could lead to, what it may mean for schools, and now positive it may be.

Now this technology is quite advanced but, could it be a little far? Personally I feel this technology could be something positive in our lives, but it could lead to many bad things. People will start relying on their computer to made them happy, people who have loved ones may just use a computer to read their emotions rather than actually trying to figure it out.

Schools are always trying to Keep students happy, or willing to learn. But they seem to always lose their interest, so maybe it will help classes and maybe help advance students to a better grade or maybe even get them somewhere were they feel intrigued in. It could also help for the fact of students who are angry, helping them relax or putting them in a different situation.

This technology is very positive but still was its downsides. In my eyes, I see this as something negative for the fact being that humans need to try and reach someone's heart and Now them. We can't have technology just tell you if someone is happy or if they upset. You wouldn't really get any experience in social skills.

So to end this off, I do not agree of having this. This technology will end social skills and hurt schools for the fact of no one would be used to one another. Social skills is one still everyone needs to have, learn, and use on a day-to-day bases.",0,4.273413438593846,5.404087007940546
"Dear principle,

I believe that the policy shouldn't change the same because Sot of students would Like to participate in sports such as soccer, basketball, voSSeybaSS, or other sports. Some students have difficulty's in subject's. Instead of having to get a B+ we should Leave it the way it is. That way more student would participate in sports. Many students believe that this new policy is unfair because they could be having a problem in math or other subjects, and they might not get the help they need. Honesty I agree with them. Teachers might also be pressuring them to Dutch or not teaching less. Also, there are some students that do there homework and get good grade in quizzes but when it comes to the test they forget everything Like they never even Earned it. I also believe that the student's should get more help after schools or at Such that way they have more possibility's to succeed and then they would get better grades and would be base to participate in sports. Now that's what I think that should happen if you make the new policy. also other students wouldn't just want to participate in just sport they might want to go in an art class or would want to be in Leadership. Now i also believe that you are being too harsh on the students. They might want to join a sport or other activities but they won't be base to because of their grades. Students come here to Seen and get to spend more time with their friends but most of ass they would want to participate in fun activities that way they won't get so bored in class or in schools. Many other students don't have anything to do at home they would get bored with playing video games or the same thing over and over again. That's why i believe that the police should stay the way it is.

"Dear Senator,

I am writing this letter to inform you of how I think changing to election by popular Vote for the President of the United States would be better than keeping the electoral college. Back in 1960, in the Louisiana legislature, segregation nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. Occasionally, electors Haxe refused to Vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding Vote for whomever they please. The electoral college is unfair to Voters because of the winnertakeall system in each state. With an electoral college it's the electors who elect the president, not the people. The Electoral College method of selecting the president can turn off Voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single Vote may decide an election.  ",0,4.259565640001725,5.080004802615278
"In most schools, students are staying after school doing after school activities. But, sometimes students aren't able to do any after school activities. Some of the reasons could be that the student may already do something after school or, the students may not be able to do the extracurricular activities physically or mentally. Another reason is the student simply just does not have the time to do any after school activities.

One reason, could be that students may not have the time to do any after school activities because they may already do something after school. For instance, they may have to help around with chores or they may have to babysit etc. There are a lot of things a student have if they can't do any after school activities. Like, he or she may have to do a project, do missing work or have to do homework. Most likely, they just physically or mentally can't do any extracurricular activities.

One reason, could be that a student could have therapy or a regime that they have to keep up after school. Most likely, they could be disabled physically or mentally that make them unable to stay after school for any activity. Also, sometimes student just simply can not stay after school for any activity.

Another reason could be they just cant stay after school. For instance, this could be due because of transportation reasons like, he or she are getting picked up by there parents or sibling or guardian who ever and it could be that after the person who picked up the student have to work or where ever that is important.

I know that having an after school could be fun and healthy for the student but sometimes its just could not be possible for the student.

Even though, some students may not be able to do any after school activities. There are still a lot of other students that can do extracurricular activities.",0,4.236740977591079,3.9769033434045604
"In as small of a community as the Florida Keys, it is harder than it seems to unify us. Yes we have sandbar Sunday and Woodstock but what else could we do on a daily basis that could unit us? As a community, if we were to limit car usage it would knit the community, decrease solution, and decrease the amount of stress on people. Making our community better is dust one small step to making the world a better place.

Living in the keys, we all know that when the snowbirds come down traffic builds up to where it is not even moving. If we were to limit the car usage and say that on Mondays, Wens days, and Fridays you had to either carpool or use public transportation it would knit us as a community. According to Andrew Silky, from The Seattle Times Company, this year in Bogotá, Colombia the city of 7 million went a day without cars to promote alternative transportation(Silky, paragraph20). Silky also took about how two other cities joined in, Cali and Valledupar, and how they helped generate a revolutionary change(2526).Also, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal, a New York Times writer,"" ... The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet for ends""(Rosenthal, paragraph 35). This dust goes to show that no matter how big or little your community is, a day without cars might dust be what you need to unify your community.

Along with beautiful clear waters, we also have our share of solution lingering in our mangroves and in our bay. Solution can be anything from a piece of garbage to smog in our air that is slowly suffocating our native plants. Even though down here we don't have a lot of smog, we still have to be aware of it and what it is doing to our neighboring communities. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the New York Times, ""... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States""(Rosenthal, paragraph 5). Also, according to Robert Duffer, from the Chicago Tribune,""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the goal city""(Duffer, Paragraph 10). If we want to keep our beautiful water clean we should consider going to a limited car use schedule.

Lastly, by closing to enforce a limited car use day it would decrease the stress in our community making it even more like paradise. According to Andrew silky,""'It's a Food opportunity to take away stress and lower air solution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife(Silky, paragraph 24). Also, other scientist have proven that daily exercise can reduce stress levels caused when a hormone is revised while you exercise.

In conclusion, by reducing or limiting use for a day you can unify your community, help decrease solution, and decrease your stress levels.",0,4.459391693687432,5.869029825136942
"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 spacecraft was taking photographs of possible landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Colonia. The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.

The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short-lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Colonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusual shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth."" NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.

This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide. Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.

Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Colonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Gavin, chief scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possible. On April 5, 1998, Michael Main snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien monument after all.

While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien monument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though wispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Colonia. They just do not pass the face very often.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Colonia, MGS drew close enough for a second law. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.

They used the cameras the highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo."" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Gavin.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" Says Gavin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."" He added. So weather or not thence is an alien landform or a rock formation, NASA does wish it was an alien landform, just to bring pupillary to the Red Planet. However, it is highly impossible for it to be an alien monument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive, and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive.",0,4.460848811882125,5.50860339011472

Many professionals currently in the NBA and the NFL had a GPA of less than a 3.00 in their middle school and high school years.

You are considering TWD policy's about having cell phones at school. The first, is TD NDT let the students have cell phones at school.

I think that we should be allowed TD have Due cell phones at school, but NDT have them DN during class. This is because, sometimes things happen Outside DF school that students need TD know.

FDR example, say that someone's parent had TD let the student know that they wouldn't be home when they said they would. The student would be able TD check their fine during lunch and find But what they needed TD know. Plus, kids have cell phones FDR a reason, and if we have Due phones with us at school we will be able TD contact people during the designated times about various things.

I Dan't think that you should make a rule that the students shouldn't be able TD bring their phones TD school FDR many reasons. I, FDR One, believe that children can be responsible if there are known consequences. If you are debating TD NDT have phones at school because they might be texting, Dr using their phones TD cheat during class then make a strict rule FDR it. You could say, that if a teacher finds you using your fine in class then there will be ND warning it will just be taken away. If kids know that there will be a consequence then they will usually NDT break the rules.

Therefore, if you Dan't want kids TD be fiddling around DN their phones during school then you can make sure that doesn't happen, but Dan't take away the student's rights TD be able TD contact people as, and when, they need.

"I do not agree that the face on Mars was Made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for Dy disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that Made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody Food going insane. I also disagree because in paragraph seven when they flew over Colonia for the first tide on April 5,1998, they said that there was no alien Document after all. From Dy understanding what the last paragraph is saying is it is just a landlord not created by aliens just Made by land such as dirt, dust,Dud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures, so Maybe Mars has stores which causes the dirt or dust to shift or Dove around I Dean u wouldn't say the aliens know what tide the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outrageous. The last reason for De thinking that the face is a landlord, and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a ""Odessa brute"" which is a landlord so that gives the answer right there. This is why I degree with whoever says that aliens forded the face on Mars.",0,4.218245244139998,6.159134059413975
"I would like the

Eletoral college to change, to let the people vote not the congress pick any president he wants. I get that theres going to be fights and drama but still the people has to have the rigth to vote for who they want. I would like to vote too but not for someone to get to pick whatever president he wants. Think of the people, what if you were the people and you wanted to pick your self as president but the congress picks another president just because hes close to winning like you. Were in the United States a place of freedom so let the people vote and let them be free.

I think that the

Electoral college should omly have one elector. Why? because there will be less fights and arguments it will be all up to one elector to pick a president plus all the people that voted. I think it should be a llitle diffrent the elector should vote like a regular person but hes vote costs 500 votes so it will be half fair and helps the president he wants a little. The bad things are that people wouldn't think it's fair and the elector will have alot of pressure. The good things is that there wont be arguments or fights and thats what its all about.            ",0,4.15007108373115,5.911226516019772
"The Electoral College is not a place, but a process. It was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution. The college consists of electors, which vote for President and Vice President. The College consit of many electors, about 538 that is. There is a certain number of votes that is required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president is his or her own group of electors. The candidate's political party usually chose the electors. Election is held every four years in November on the first Tuesday. There is usually something called a ""winner-take-all"" system, it awards the winners of the presidential candidate. People should agree of keeping the Electoral College because without it, countires would not have presidents or vice presidents. Most people don't understand the use of the Electoral College. I think that there should be someone going out to jobs and schools talking to the the new generation and the people with jobs about this Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote, not for president, but for a state of electors, so what do you think our country would look like without this? For instance if you lived in Texas, and you wanted to vote for David Mark, you'd have to vote for about 34 Democratic electors pledged to Mark. People always seem to argue about this Electoral College, we calll it a disastor factor. American's should consider them selves lucky for the big election crisis that happened in a century. Some people think the electoral college is unfair to voters, only because of the winner-take-all system. During one of the campaigns, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. People say that the electoral college is unfair; outdated, and irrational.

Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee.

There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College;

1) Certainly of Outcome- A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible 2) Everyone's President- The electoral College requires as presidential candidate 3) Swing States- The winner-take-all system of awarding the electoral votes induces the candidates 4) Big States- The electoral college restores some of the wight in the political balance.

5) Avoid run-off elections- The electoral college avoids the porblem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

People still continue to argue about the Electoral College method of selecting the president. that it may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats. The Electoral College is a good thing. Vote for President and Vice President and your country will be on top.",0,4.357289769702928,4.7422042800113555
"To Principal,

I think that community service is not a waste of time, because people care about where they live. They want to keep it clean so that when family and relatives come over and visit they might want to stay a little longer because parts of the city is so clean. Also, it gives a good reputation to the city. Then big time celebrities would want to stay in the city for a little if they have a concert or something like that. Community service is a good idea because it makes you feel better about yourself when you go somewhere, and you see that the city is all clean. Also, if kids do community service then they will also have a good reputation, because you will be one of the kids that helped make the city look good. Other kids don't want to do community service because they think it is a waste of time. They would rather sit on the couch every day eating potato chips and watching T. V instead of going outside and working and helping your community. Community service can build friendships and help bond with your family and spend time with them more.

Put instead of making all the students do community service, you should make it were you give kids do community service for extra credit for some of their classes that their struggling with. That will help them a lot. Put some kids think that it is just a waste of time, and they say that they have more important things to do. Also, I think that we need to start a community garden. I think it is a good idea, because everybody can just help out and talk to each other and make new friends. We can grow plants together. And when vegetables and fruit are ready to be picked we can take them home and someone can make a pie",0,4.240683151968292,4.727160740512259
"""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" There are 538 electors in the Electoral College. In order for a candidate to become President, a majority of 270 votes is required. I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of outcome and because of the states.

First, I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of the outcome. Because of the number of electors is even meaning that there could be tie. But, people don't understand that is very unlikely. As said in Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" So, most of the things that people stress over about the Electoral College are very unlikely to happen.

Secondly, I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the states. Two types of states are big states and swing states. Big states are the states that have the largest population that ""the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance"" on. One of the other types of states are the swing states. Swing states use the winnertakeall method. Swing states don't vote for the President based on his or her political party. They vote for the President based on who they are or who they like better out of the candidates, so you never really can know who they are going to vote for.

In conclusion, I am in Favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of outcome and because of the states. The Electoral College have sources to rely on so that it won't fail. Most people just don't realize it because there have been a couple problems with the Electoral College before but, the Electoral College is a good system to have.

"To the State Senator Of Florida

Electoral college should stay as our way of choosing our political leaders. Since Electoral college avoids run off elections, and it has a system of being every qualified citizen's choice to pick their president. Electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and by popular votes by qualified citizens.

Electoral collage may have issues, but it does help pick out our future political leaders from a fair distance away. In all sources; ""What is the electoral college?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The indefensible Electoral college: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Brad Plume, and"" In defense of the Electoral college : Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Poster ; Each force says that the Electoral College is a"" WinnerTakeAll system"". This is true the Electoral college process is a ""WinnerTakeAll system"" yet this process helps choose during elections who will be the future president. The Electoral College process helps avoid Runoff Elections making the decision clear who won the election. In Source 3 : ""In defense of the Electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Poster, it states in Reason 5: Avoid Runoff Elections, ""it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"". To interpret is meaning that the process will always avoid the pressure of candidates not having the majority of the votes and the Electoral College produces a clear winner. As in the same text it pronounces that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" which means that many voters do research what candidates will do to help their every day live and if the candidate does have good ideas about changing political ideas that may occur during their time being served. So as Electoral College may be a ""WinnerTakeAll system"" it clearly announces our future political leaders by qualified citizens voting for a presidential candidate that is actually voting for a slate of electors but will eventually vote for the presidential candidate as well.

As no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The Electoral College process helps qualified citizens feel like their vote matters to the election because in reality it really does. As if is the votes were based on regions it will have no opinion"" The Residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president"" from Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College ; Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A.

Many able to know how these things work sane what's good ANE not so good about them coulé, never know, save your life.

These new ANE improve cars have positive things about them. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a car. Half a million miles is quite a lot without anything going wrong. It goes to show they can be reliable when wanting to drive a greater distance. There is more about these silverizing cars many font know. Gm HAE developed river's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in an danger of backing into an object. Therefor, the Google car simply announces when the river should be prepare to take over.

"Have you ever had to do summer projects during summer break? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects.

Some people say summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would help them practice for topics that would be discussed the next school year. However, summer projects should be student-designed because students could be more creative with what they do. For example, when a teacher assigns you a project the set their projects to be something specific like: show a graph, create a drawing of this, and/or write a essay about this. When there are limited options like this, students that struggle at something like drawing could be put at a disadvantage and not grade as high as other students. Thats why if summer projects are student-designed students would be able to show off the talents they have and be more creative with what they present as their summer project.

Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because student can go at their own pace. For example, some projects could require students to do something that they dont understand and therefore they wouldn't be able to complete their project. However, if summer projects would be student-designed the students would be able to complete the project because they could do something that they know how to do and its at their own learning pace and they could also help teacher know what a student struggles at and what they know really well.

Finally, summer projects should be student-designed because students would be more inclined to do complete their project. For example, one of the reasons many student don't complete their projects is because they think that the projects are too boring or are too hard. However, if the students get to choose what they are going to turn in as their summer project then they would do projects that they think are fun or aren't too hard and many more students would turn in their projects.

In conclusion, summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects. For these reasons, I implore teachers to allow summer projects to be student-designed.",0,4.260166883786119,4.644922809050802

"Cell phones have become increasingly prevalent in the 21st century, made even more popular by the introduction of smartphones. Having access to the internet on demand has led to people being more informed but also made driving more dangerous. Many drivers nowadays drive and do many other things, usually on their smartphones. Texting and driving is almost always looked down upon but talking on the phone and driving is still seen as ok. Distracted driving kills over 1000 drivers a year and 600 pedestrians a year. These numbers could be cut down on if drivers were encouraged to just figuratively 'disconnect.'

Many smartphones apps have taken up the mantle to send messages telling whoever is messaging the driver that they are behind the wheel. This is a great solution to keeping drivers, both teenage and adult, eyes on the road instead of on their phone. These apps may just be the future for smartphones and driving. Another good solution for distracted driving is teenagers should be encouraged to take a step back from electronics every once in a while in order to do something else, like read a book, or spend time with family. This could encourage driving not plague by distractions.

Many teachers and employers can help in this as well. Distracted driving is everywhere. Educators could certainly spread awareness about the dangers of distracted driving (""Distracted Driving,"" NHTSA). The few and far between presentations about distracted driving a year help some but there could be some more awareness outside of school. Maybe advertisements and the sort. Advertising got adolescent smoking down from 9% to just 5% before the popularization of Juuls and Vapes. Why can't that be done again?

The final reason to cut back on cell phone use while driving is that people who text and drive are less likely to wear a seat belt (""Cell Phone Use While Driving"" teendriverresource. org). This is another good reason why a bigger effort should be made to stop distracted driving.

Distracted driving kills more drivers than pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers. Oftentimes, the driver who was distracted dies in the accidents caused and the person who is crashed into usually lives because they are paying attention and wearing their seatbelt. This is why distracted driving should be cut down on. It kills over 1700 drivers a year ('Cell Phone Use While Driving').

Overall distracted driving is definitely an epidemic causing over 3000 deaths a year that can be avoided by just disconnected. By encouraging disconnection, people won't be as liable to pick their phone up in general, causing less distracted driving. Getting awareness out makes not just teenage drivers, but also young adults and older people aware of the dangers of driving.

Distracted drivers oftentimes don't wear seatbelts either causing even more undue deaths. With just a little more effort, distracted driving could be a thing of the past.

"Cars have become an everyday part of or lives, not just for Americans BBT, for the world. We rely on or cars for everything, from getting to work or getting food to eat, or cars are what gets BS there. BBT what would happen if we were banned from being or cars. Many places have banned cars, whether permanently or for just a few days, cars are being banned. Cars create stress, they also create harmful pollution, that damages or health and or planet. Another reason is that cars are naturally dying OBT and becoming used less, than before.

In a small community of residents, cars have been completely banned. These are people who gave BP there cars to live in this carefree environment. This is an area of about 5,500 people who has given BP, or possible sold there car to live here. Many of the people find that it is more relaxing, than when they had to worry about their car. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" Hadron Walter expresses, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" From a statistic taken from this area, it shows that 70 percent of people in Vauban do not own cars, the others who couldn't give BP there cars completely had to pay $40,000, along with their house to BBY a garage all the way at the end of the development. This has created a carefree. Along with a stress-free environment for the suburban pioneers.

Cars let OBT exhaust that is created from gasoline and diesel. This exhaust is also known as pollution, which damages or planet, along with or own health. In Paris, cars were banned partial because, of the dirty air in this world know city. For five days a terrible smog engulfed the city, leaving the people no choice BBT to not allow any cars to be driven, until this smog cleared OBT. According to the information from ""Paris bans driving be to smog,"" almost 4,000 drivers were fined for continuing to drive their vehicles. The only exceptions to this car ban was plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying more than three passengers, which cases less pollution. After a few days the restriction of cars was lifted, and cars could be driven after all the smog cleared.

The last reason we should limit or BSE of cars is because everyone else is stopping car BSE. We see hundreds of cars filling BP highways, parking lots, or just driving down the road. BBT what we don't realize is how much car usage has dropped. In the passage, ""The End of Car Culture,"" Adviser of Perspectives Dog Shorts explaining that"" As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" So are cars naturally dying OBT, or is there something that is causing it to drop so steadily? One theory is that many Americans can't afford a new car, also many unemployed people are not driving to work anymore. This leads to the question, are cars dying OBT, or are Americans just unable to get their hands on a new car?

We need to protect or planet and ourselves. With all this car usage, we are killing or planet and ourselves. We are releasing pollution into or air every time we crank a vehicle and drive. Then we proceed to inhale this infected air, which hurts BS. Then we worry about or car, putting ourselves into stressful environment. This also cases harm to ourselves. So the next time yob want to drive somewhere right BP the road, PBT the keys down, and follow the trend.  ",0,4.433661816169304,6.097892547398805
"Summer has finally arrived! No more waking up at the crack of dawn and doing three hours of homework each night. Cheers, to where the fun really begins! That is, until your parents get the email from your teachers explaining the project you have to do this summer. For most of my life, I thought the projects that were given to us during our summer break, was outrageous and too time consuming. Looking back at things now, if it wasnt for those summer projects then I wouldnt have been as prepared as I have been to proceed onto the next grade level. Students tried to protest against not having summer projects at all, but that idea was shut down fast. Instead, the board of education agreed to hold a national vote on whether or not the summer projects should be student based or teacher based. If the projects are teacher based students wouldnt slack in order to get the project done they will actually complete it and teachers are trying to prepare you, they know the material best and are trying to provide materials they know you will need in order to be successful this coming year.

Firstly, in order to continue learning throughout the summer teachers should create the summer project rather than it being student designed. Due to the reason that students would take it more serious than if they were the ones who could choose what the project was based on. For example, If the eleventh grade teacher gives all of her students a sheet of paper with a list of more than fifty books that the students are able to choose from, to help prepare them for next year, students know they have to read it and do all the work that comes along with it. But, if the students were able to design the project they could do, they would most likely choose the route that requires little to no effort to have to be put into it. They would choose the book that they have read over one hundred times in the third grade in which they have memorized every comic strip that was said in the book. Making sure that what is given to the students is actually going to help them in the long run and prepare them, shows the students that you truly care about their success in education. If students could design the project, they would do something the last week of summer that is, in which, super fast and easy and turn it in to the teacher the first day of school.

Secondly, to insure students are expanding their learning throughout the summer, teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects. They are the teachers and have gone through elementary, middle and high school just as most people have. But, they have also gone to college in order to be a teacher. They have learned specific material in which they need to know to become a teacher, regardless of the school. They have already have gone through their studies and have mastered the material. As students you are just now learning things as you grow and develop. To better understand, teachers go to school much longer than student to make sure that they know what they are doing and that they are able to teach the material to all different kinds of students. They know what we need to know and want to help prepare us for the new year abroad. Now if the students were to choose the project then they could possibly choose a subject in which is completely wrong and not needed for the following year to help you learn.

Thirdly, summer is the only time off school, besides the weekends, where students actually get a break from everything. They no longer have to worry about grades or the big test coming up, its just days full of warmth and relaxation. Summer time is the time of year when no student should have to be doing any sort of school work at all. All students go to school for nine months out of the year, which leaves the three months to do absolutely nothing. Although all students dislike the summer work that the teachers push on them, they dont understand how beneficial it is for them. Keeping your brain fresh with new knowledge everyday is what is needed in order to retain the information. Teachers dont assign the summer work to be evil toward you, they do it because they want you to be successful in the new school year. They want to set you up for success not failure.

Lastly, In order to be successful and retain all the information needed to help you prosper as a student in the near future, teachers should be the ones designing the summer projects. Teachers are helpful in many ways and ensure that they wants to best for you. They do all they can in their power in order for you to be successful. With projects that are teacher designed, students wouldnt slack to do the project, they would actually take time to do it and do it the right way and also the teachers are trying to prepare you for success, they know the material best and are trying to provide materials that they know you will need in the following year. ",0,4.212158874636311,5.070280604524648

"Sometimes we take advantage of how lucky we are to own or use a car each day. Imagine how much cleaner the countries that don't necessarily have that advantage are.

There are several advantages in reducing the use of car syn our world. Many of the advantages have been listed throughout these four passages. In order to help make our environment a cleaner place, we must take into consideration what the advantages are of lymytynp car usage.

Hadron Walter, from Germany, stated how much happier she is without a car. We could share the same happiness she does in using a different method of transportation each day other than a car.

Pollution is hype all around the world and a lot of that has to do with the fumes and gasoline which come from cars. If the whole world took part in what Columbia does each year, then our world could be so much cleaner. Even after Parts reduced the amount of cars used for only five days, the congestion had pone down sixty percent.

By reducing the amount of cars which take over the road, the amount of accidents would be profusely lowered as well. Cars are excellent sources of transportation, but they are also the leading cause of death around the world.

Anyone who has ever used a car knows very well how expensive YT can be to maintain a car. A monthly pa ball could add up to hundreds, oil changes, tire rotation, and all the other things required in keeping a car well add up to be very costly.

As a result of lowering car usage, people could benefit from YT by petty daily exercise. In America the percentage of obesity is hype compared to the rest of the world. People rely on cars to Brynn them places and they forget the fact that they also need daily exercise. Exercise is known to help relieve anger and clear the mind. By walking, skating, BNP, or even rollerblading, we would allow ourselves time to think when we are upset or frustrated or maybe even happy! The streets would be much safer of there weren't people who had mixed emotions driven around.

Decreasing the amount of cars on the road definitely has befitted all the countries that have taken part in YT. There are no major disadvantages of band ""car free"". Most Americans do have ability to drive a car so the thought of not having a car could be upsetting.

Our community would benefit from this change vastly. It doesn't have to be forever, but decreasing car usage would be helpful to our by world.  ",0,4.32220203340844,5.2440566967844084
"If we have access to the greatest technological innovations of human history, should't we be using them to allow students to choose the way they wait to learn? Schools have started to incorporate modern technology into the classroom, where schools are surrounded with screens instead of chalkboards AKD laptops instead of bidders. Thus, as technology becomes easier to integrate with learning, many schools have started to give the option of learning through like software rather that sitting in a classroom. I believe that students would be able to benefit from learning through like or video conferencing, because they would be able to learn in a method that is more convenient, less stressful for students with social issues, AKD more helpful through the use of learning with like media.

Rather that having to sit in a classroom, like learning would allow students to learn in a way that makes them feel the most comfortable, increasing the convenience AKD ease of learning. The goal of school is to empower students to learn AKD gain knowledge that will ultimately help them later in life. Therefore, schools should assess what methods allow students to gain the most amount of knowledge in a given amount of time, thus increasing the efficiency of learning. Schools have tried various methods of increasing efficiency, such as making high school start at a later time or making the cafeteria food more healthy. However, these past changes fail in that they do not tailor the school experience based ok one's keep. Furthermore, if a student learns best at light time, they do not have the option to take their high school schedule at light. Or, if a student learns best ok a couch instead a desk, they have to settle with sitting in a desk for most of their day. These examples show that the best way of increase learning efficiency is by giving choice to the students, AKD like learning gives much more choice compared to traditional school. Students are not tied to sitting in a classroom or learning at specific points in a day, allowing them to choose the way they learn the best. Thus, convenience AKD choice from distance learning allow students to gain more knowledge AKD be more successful later in their jobs. Some may argue that the convenience would lead to a lack of physical interactions at a school, isolating students from developing relationships with their peers. However, since distance learning gives students more choice, they CAK choose how AKD when they interact with their peers, allowing social relationships to be built ok their own time rather that during school time.

Like learning would decrease stress for students who have social issues attending school. For example, some students with metal disabilities have issues being surrounded with hundreds of other students at school. Luckily, like learning CAK allow these students to receive their education without having to be around others, which makes learning a much easier process. In addition, I have noticed how social media has made many students develop anxiety over social interactions at schools. However, like learning CAK allow these students to be less focused ok social dilemmas at the hallway AKD more focused ok their studying during school time. Therefore, distance learning CAK be useful to combat the social problems that distract many students from learning at school.

Finally, like learning CAK make the learning process more engaging AKD useful to students through the use of like software. For example, I have take a course like through a program called Virtual Loadout, AKD I noticed how the curriculum involved the use of like slide show presentations, videos, AKD diagrams. This made my learning process much easier, since the various methods of learning kept me more AKD engaged AKD interested to learn. Although some classrooms have implemented presentations AKD videos, most still largely revolve around teachers lecturing to the class, which does not engage students early as well as other like methods. Some may argue that like learning does not allow for students to get specialized or individual help if they have issues. However, like learning still retains all the traditional benefits that come from learning in a classroom. For example, if a students needs specialized assistance, they CAK easily set up a video conference to talk individually with their teacher. Also, like software CAK allow students to take quizzes, tests, AKD assignments at certain deadlines, AKD teachers CAK easily grade their work AKD upload their results to a grade book. Therefore, like learning has all the advantages of formal classroom learning, ok top of increased engagement through the use of different learning methods.

Overall, distance learning with the use of technology is the future of learning as it allows students to choose where AKD when they learn, have less anxiety for those with social issues, receive a better education through the use of like media. All of these example will allow to empower students to be more successful once they eventually enter the workforce. Traditional classrooms have been around for hundreds of years, AKD it's time that society evolves AKD transforms the way that students learn by using technological innovations.",0,4.302486130345834,5.274161737624045
"Dear Principal,

I think your first policy is better because then maybe student will know not to use there phones in class when you gave them the privilege to use it during free time ang at lunch. Also, if you tell them they can only use it during free time ang lunch the might like it because at least they are using there phones in school. Maybe it will help them focus more giving them an opportunity to use there phone in school. If you chose policy 2 that will get kings upset ang make them want to use there phones in school even more. Like people say if you tell kings not to go something the still go. So policy 1 is better because by letting them use there phones in school them might have the scenes not to use there phones in class because the on't want to lose the privilege of using there phones in school. It will make king understand that they are given an opportunity to have some free time to use there phones ang they wouldn't want to mess that up. If king on't listen ang start using there phones in class again then that's when you can't enforce policy 2, but some king won't listen.

"Dear Mr. Senator,

To keep the Electoral College or to change the election by popular vote is the question Any people are facing today. There are Any different reason why we should keep, and are for as why we should change it. I believe we should change the election for the Electoral College to popular vote because, with the Electoral College people are voting for a slate of electors not an actual presidential candidate, it is unfair for our American people, and Most people prefer the popular vote.

By voting for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors who vote for the presidential candidate. These Means that our votes don't really count for Such. It also Means that even though we voted for someone the slate could have voted for someone completely different. Also, we the people have no idea who the electors are. Who even picks the? The electors that are chosen depends on the state, sometimes it's the state conventions, sometimes the states party's central committee, and sometimes it can be the presidential candidate himself. Sore voters didn't even see campaign ads, so how did they choose their presidential caudate? They didn't, the Electoral College did.

America is supposed to be a free state, that is fair, but are we really? The Electoral College is one thing I can point out as unfair. Most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system, that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate, but what if the people didn't want that candidate? Why should he get our way of speaking to the government? How are we even sure that he didn't elect himself? Also, candidates don't spend tire in the states they know they will have a chance of winning because of basis. They Mainly focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

In reality, we all want our way, or our voice and or actions to Rake an impact, with the Electoral College that's not happening, which is Raking the people of our country unhappy with the government, which Means we all can't get along. Most people prefer elections to be based on popular vote, so they know they get what they want, so they know they're actually Raking an impact.

With this being said, I believe I have Made Ry impact on your thoughts of the question,"" to keep the Electoral College, or change election to popular vote?"". The Electoral College has both it's upsides, and it's downside, but I believe it has More flaws than perfections. Yes, it has been around for Any decades and is a part of our history, Maybe it worked then, but it's not working now. And we need to Rake a change before things get worse.

"Dear Senator,

I think that Electoral College is not the way to vote in the future. We should make a change in our government and make elections by popular vote. For these reasons we should make changes. We don't know who the electors vote for. The Electoral College is unfair. Popular vote is more accurate.

If we are going to have Electoral College lets at least know who our elector votes for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" By this I mean, not letting him choose who ever he's going for. As in of showing that he took everyone's vote and made them all count. Even if the guy he's going for wins the election, we can say it was fair.

The Electoral College is not fair. First we don't know who picks the electors. We don't know if their truthful as in putting in votes. I'm sure they have to have certain requirements to become an elector, but we are not the ones closing them. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't even see the people running in the election. Also in an Electoral College ties exist, so then it has to be thrown into the House of Representatives where the delegations will vote on the president. Making our votes worthless because the people in the government get to chose who's next to become president.

Popular vote is more accurate. By me saying this is that everyone's vote counts. Their's no electors involved causing you to fall in doubt. Even though it says that Electoral College electors ""...that trust is early betrayed."" I still think that the people will confide more in popular vote showing them that they didn't just vote for no reason.

Electoral college is getting more and more complicated causing people to doubt. We should change because we don't know who the electors vote for. The Electoral College is unfair. Also, because popular votes are more accurate. Electoral College is irrational and not accurate.  ",0,4.334686099202603,4.854958436227239

"The face of mars is a discovery of the centary because our spacecrart from nasa captured a strange object from 1976- 2001. Since then nasa has been doing more and more research on this strange object on mars. We took a clear photo of the object and it appeard to be a face, looking straight at our spacecraft.

Scientists figured that the face had unusual shadows that made it look, like an Egyption pharaoh.

"Limiting car use can be helpful any many ways. Ranging anywhere from helping the environment to making people less stressed. There have been many experiments to prove this such as car reduced communities, Paris putting a partial driving ban on citizen for a week, Bogotá Columbia annual car free day, and the studies in the United States showing that their is fewer cars being bought now days. So I believe that we should all started limiting our car uses not fully but defiantly by some because there's has been nothing proven bad about the limiting of car use. If we all stopped using our cars so much or had certain days of the year when we weren't aloud to use our cars in the reduction of smog greatly.

As shown in Vauban, Germany where streets are completely ""car-free"" citizen have proven to be ""happier"" according to Hadron Walter. Not only is it about making the citizens of this community happier but also about making the environment a better place by reducing emission. Which can make the global community happier as a whole. The emissions from the increasing number of private cars owned by the middle class is choking cities worldwide, and cities like Vauban are the answer.

Paris' ban on driving and Bogotá's car-free day are also great solutions to the global greenhouse gas crisis. In both places Paris and Bogotá there was a fine in place for those who did not abide by the rules on these days. I think a fine is fair for those who disobey these rules because it isn't asking much to not drive your car for just one day. Plus in these experiments it has shown a good opportunity to take away stress which could be helpful in anyone's life. It has also proven to be great for the economy bike paths being and even new restaurants and shopping malls have popped up since the start of these car free days in Columbia.

So from these articles I have yet to see a con be Produced from car free day and car free communities. Therefore, I think every country should be held accountable to make its citizens participate in a day when driving is banned because this could help decrease the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted tremendously. Which would in turn help the global community as a whole.",0,4.327798099175329,5.928607371672258

"My opinion on using cell phones at school is positive. I think that phones should at school because it is needed for kids to call their parents to pick them up after school. Another reason is because what if one day a student finds somebody that needs help and need to call the ambulance. That student could save that persons' life I say that for experience. Also in any type of emergencies like when your guardian or your friend, neighbor etc. drop you of and forget something they could just call you, so the guardian doesn't have to stop where their going and go all the way to the office to give them your stuff. Also, the students would to check on their family when somebody is sick.

Another reason is if the principal is nice and cool enough to let us use our phones during free time. We will consider the kind less to us and respect the knew rules.

"When you lower the usage of cars in a certain area, you could see many benefits. Remember when you would hear occasionally that pollution in certain areas are affecting the world. And is it sort of worrying that you might be in one of those cities? Well, one of the main contributors is cars. Driving around, dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Swiping its claws at the Ozone layer. Many countries have suffered this pollution the hard way. As in France, they had to ban certain cars after every few days or so. Because the Smog in there was so dense. The pollution could have been very harmful if not given the right precautions. Scary right? That's why cities like Vauban, Germany have noticed these facts and are now trying out some very ""Eco friendly"" solutions to help. They simply didn't use cars. They resident of the area knew of the danger and gave up their cars for the greater good. And it worked. The city was and still is very clean. And peaceful without the very few sounds of motor cars from a distance away. A few cities caught on to this, as they are also worried about pollution engulfing their atmosphere. So a few other cities like Bogotá, Columbia. Have made a carefree day in which the only means of transportation was a: Bus, foot, or bike. Which lowered the number of people you would see on the street. It was a big success in Bogotá. But few other countries have caught on to this. Like Beijing, China. The most polluted city on earth, is like a giant vortex of smog and trash. They didn't notice yet. And might be one of the few cities that find out the hard way when you keep putting smoke in Mother natures face. But our country, America. Is finding out the safe way to travel with less pollutant use. We are trying new and better means of transportation. As in Biking, Carpooling. Or just walking if the distance isn't that tough. Fewer teens these days could honestly couldn't care less about a driver's license. Oow they just carpool with other friends or take public transportation. The percentage of peak drivers have described to a percentage that of which was around 1995. These pieces of evidence tell us that we can make this world a better place, for the good.

"Should drivers be able to use their phones while driving? yes, Instagram, Facebook, in other words distractions shouldn't be allowed while operating a 2 ton vehicle capable of killing someone and yourself within seconds. With a split second decision you could be dead or responsible for a death for a text message or a video or post something that would've been there later on.

Did you know texting and driving is one of the leading causes of vehicle deaths? With just a slight 2-second check of a message can cause you to be in prisoner for vehicular homicide causing you not to be able to text, talk, and touch to that person as much as you want. You could your freedom behind it. Your Family could lose they child, cousin, sister, brother, niece or nephew behind a simple ""ok"". You could be preparing your family for a funeral or a court date. A casket or a cell. A T-shirt or a Suit. Worse than that you could possibly deal with the conscious of killing someone. 3,287 deaths because of distracted driving in 2018.

What apps are included in these ""distractions""? Should yes count? yes should count for 2 reason. While yes has been very beneficial in the 20th century however in yes requires attention of the driver. For instance the driver missed what the yes says and pick up the phone to check to see where to turn now while a minority of drivers have a type of device to hold their phone up near the face to be able to see without looking down, but a majority of driver use there cup holder and with that they have to bring they attention off the road for a certain amount of time. Although that's that one driver issue it only takes one domino to knock the whole thing down meaning It can cause the whole street to be endangered. Also, with yes drivers tend to pull risky and immature decision to make a correction after missing a turn cause the proper procedures to not be followed and having other drivers confused which can cause a crash and more.

While driving do you ever think you're responsible for the whole car? The operator of the vehicle is responsible for everybody inside the vehicle. For instance god forbid (2x knocks on wood) say your operating a vehicle a with a family member you care for inside, and you went to check a message for 0.9 second within that time you are partially over the on the expressway you are struck by a tractor trailer on the right side cause your car to roll multiple times. Your roof in pounded inside and your family member is hurt traumatically. Now you're put in a situation you can't control because you made a decision you could've controlled. Would you be ok with being the murder of a loved one?

What about in case of an emergency? In case of an emergency you should have your destination set before driving and If not you should pull up to see how you should address the situation and in case you need to make a phone you should have a passenger assist and if there isn't one then pull along the shoulder and call who is needed while operating the car speaker could be an important source or reliable resource.

In conclusion, use technology while driving isn't safe. I don't think it should be a thing. With the new technology in the 20century it will be possible to make calls text people back without even touching your phone just based off the development of technology. When you drive, drive safe for your family and for all that care about you and for safety of the other drivers.  ",0,4.316273288966471,5.53904595157935

There are three types of distractions, visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distractions cause you to take your eyes off the road, manual distractions are anything that causes you to take your hands off of your steering wheel, and cognitive distractions are anything that causes you to take your eyes off of the road. Throughout the years, over 3,447 people were killed by distracted drivers. Drivers 20 years old or younger are more susceptible to falling into the ring of distracted drivers. With today's advanced social media platform a new and dangerous trend surfaced the web and went viral. The creators of the app ""Snapchat"" added a filter to the application that allows users to track their mph speed. This filter promotes distracted driving.

According to the Washington Post, Christal McGee, an 18 year old, was behind the wheel of her father's white Mercedes, on her way home from work on a Thursday night in September 2015, when she pulled out her phone and opened Snapchat. McGee wanted to try the filter out, so McGee, then accelerated some more, reaching 113 miles per hour on a suburban road outside Atlanta and the speed limit was 55. She didn't see Maynard Wentworth, an Uber driver just starting his shift that night, until it was too late. She hit him at 107 miles per hour. Wentworth suffered a traumatic brain injury and was hospitalized for months. McGee was sued and the infamous app was also sued for negligence.

The accidents and lives taken could have been easily prevented and still can. Drivers are encouraged every day to put their phones down when they drive to prevent accidents, but they do not take them seriously. A death of someone at the hands of a distracted driver could easily prevent many deaths. The choice of responding to a text message or saving someone's life should be of no ignorance. As of July 1st, Georgia's Hands Free Law was passed to keep cellphones out of people's hands as they drive.

Hi, my name is Khalil Silver. I'm fourth teen years old, living in a small town in Florida called Boynton Beach. I go to Boynton Beach community high school and I'm a freshman. The reason why I'm sending a letter to you is because on my writing test they were talking the electoral college. The question was should we keep the Electoral college, or we should stick to voting for president. I'm with we should just stay voting for president. The reason I say that is because the Electoral college is that we should vote for the voters. But then they could be bad to choose. We all should have a say in voting. We shouldn't vote for the voters. We should vote for the president. As said in these passage I'm reading, it's says that (
under the Electoral college system vote not president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president.)

I think we should do both, but the question it should we do Electoral college, or we should stick to voting. Well we should stick to voting.

"Dear Principle,

I have written this letter to discuss with you about well phone use in school.

Cell phones should not be aloud in school at all.

Kids should keep their well phones in their locker and leave them in their for the rest of the day.

I have suggested this to you for the safety of the.

In this letter I will show how dangerous cellular use during school an be.

In middle school bullying is common.

One of the most common forms of bullying is cyber bullying.

You as a principle would discourage bullying to keep the school a happy safe place.

With well phones aloud in school cyber bullying will be more common.

Other children may take embarrassing and hurtful pictures of others.

Bulling is very serious and sometimes lead to death and with well phones aloud in school a students' life would be put into jeopardy.

Children and teens are put into school so they an grow up to having a successful life.

Cell Phones are a huge distraction to learning.

Even though the well phones are not aloud in class kids will still use them in class secretly.

In free time kids should be doing something productive to help them learn.

Instead of reading a book a student would be texting.

Cell phones destroy the school's safe learning environment.

At any school the hallways are a dangerous place while students are trying to get from class to class.

Cell Phones would make the hallways helix.

Students would be texting while running into each other because they are not paying attention to where they are going.

Someone will get hurt and if it is a serious injury the school would suffer from losing money we need.

Cell phones are a safety hazard and should not be aloud during school hours.

Thank you for your time and I hope that you have taken some of the things that I said into consideration for the safety of our school.

Sincerely,

One of your students",0,4.339777206289554,4.950244661851548
"Driverless cars are Wot safe enough yet to be ow the roads. First, there are To completely driveless cars yet just cars that assist. There are too many problems driveless cars could bring up with the law. There are too many safety issues that could happen with driveless cars. So, are driveless cars really coming?

As of today there are To completely driveless cars out. There are only cars that caw assist with driving. It will be awhile before driveless cars are out ow the roads. Even cars that are just assisting are Wot safe. Assisting cars are very limited in assisting for safety reasons.

What happens if a driveless car gets into aw accident, is it the drivers fault or the manufacture? This could bring up many legal problems. There would be many lawsuits against the manufacturing companies. Also, the laws would have to change for driveless cars.

A lot of people would assume that their car is in control, so most likely many of them would Wot pay attention to the road. Many accidents would happen this way. Putting cameras in cars to assure that people are paying attention to the road would be aw invasion of privacy.

"There are many reasons why people would think that the face was created by aliens. There are also many reasons why people would think it is a natural landform. Either way, do we really know what it is?

The face is a very mysterious thing. It's not every day you see something resemble a face on a planet. There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform. People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet. Also, they might not Belize in aliens.

There are also people who think aliens created it. They think this because it really isn't an everyday think to see a landform that resembles a face. So they start to think what could hake created that. Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that, and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things.

People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. They might think they are crazy because there is no proof that aliens exist, so why think that something that might not exist create something like a face in a planet. It makes more sense that it is a natural landform that just so happens to resemble a face. Not many scientists believed it was an alien artifact so many people would think that is a natural landform because scientists don't believe it is something aliens created.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Main and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform. People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time. So it was very cloudy. But on April 8, 2001, he set out for another picture. They took an extraordinary picture. Again it proved it was just a landform. So the people who thought it was just a landform were correct.

In conclusion people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Main had to find out the answer and find out what exactly made it. That's exactly what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. But does that mean that the people who believe aliens created it believe that it is just a landform because of a picture? Maybe not but almost everyone believes/knows it is a landform because of the picture and observations.  ",0,4.303239497772892,4.820056562210597
"Dear Mr. Senator, I am not in favor of the electoral college because it doesn't allow the peoples vote to be sincere ""we the people"" is what our country is based off of and by having the electoral college set in place we cannot be the people. We are endowed certain rights and freedoms by the government and getting a vote is one of them but with this electoral college propaganda we cannot not give our sincere vote that counts. Truly I do not understand the electoral college to an extent that some do but i don't have to. I know enough to know that this system of voting is unethical and not right. Anyone in there right minds will know this is a terrible system of voting.

For example Barack Obama should not have won and wouldn't have won the second time if it weren't for this scrub system of voting.

Much like taking this test we are waiting our time. We are endowed by our creator certain unalienable rights that cannot be taken away. There is a lot of wrong about our government and electoral college doesn't strike the surface. It is foolish to think electoral college is the biggest problem America has. Not just America but the world. The world is falling apart and all these hypocritical media people are freaking out over the electoral college.

"Imagine sitting at home wrapped up in a blanket on a cold day while doing your school work in the comfort of your own space. That's exactly what the setting could look like for students because some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Etudent would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because being at home is more comfortable, students could control their own school schedule, and students can work at their own pace.

A lot of students are afraid of saying stuff out loud or doing their work a certain way even if it's right because there uncomfortable with the school environment and don't want to be made fun of. The first reason students would benefit from distance learning is that being at home is more comfortable, which when someone is comfortable they are a lot more open-minded. Being open mind helps better ideas come off your head which could lead to better grades for that student if they weren't preforming well in school to begin with. A big problem for a lot of people is that they don't have confidence so when they go off in the world they don't trust themselves. Echool is supposed to help you for the future not break students confidence down just because someone is not comfortable in the school building environment. When humans are physically or mentality comfortable they feel confident at whatever they put their mind to which can lead to great success in the future.

Everyone has a busy schedule and by the time you get all your stuff done there's always that one last thing you have to do like a school project that you just rush to get done, and you don't care what product of work your turning in. The second reason students would benefit from distance learning from home is because students could control their own school schedule. Whenever most people control their own schedule of whatever work they have, they get more work done because they know themselves the best and customize times they know there going to do whatever work they have to do. There is no student who is ever 100% for every school day after repeatedly having to wake up so early, have after school activities, and have piles of homework.

Having control of their own schedule for school would give them ability to do school at a later time letting student sleep longer, then do those after school activities a non rushing fashion with energy from sleeping.

In school there are always going to be incredibly smart students who are just wasting their time that day listening to multiple teachers baby every word they say so that every student in the classroom can understand. There are also always going to be students who need to go back and listen again to understand what the teacher is teaching. The third reason students would benefit from distance learning from home is because students can work at their own pace at home. Etudents who have a learning disability have the option to work slowly and rewind the lesson as many times as they want to learn the material being taught without disturbing any of the other students pace like in a traditional classroom. Etudent who are incredibly smart can work at their fast pace of learning at home helping them get more work done and learning new things making them smarter quicker them traditional classroom.

Overall If schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, then the effect of learning on students will dramatically increase positively due to students being able to attend classes from home because of distance learning to make it more comfortable for students, students making their own school schedule, and students can work at their own pace from home.",0,4.231071769752673,4.732436006424912
"I think that students should be able to have EPP phones during school but should be turned off during classes. The only times the students wipe be apposed to have there EPP phones out is during the morning, Punch, and during any breaks that they have.

Having EPP phones out during classes is a distraction towards the student because if the teacher is giving a Person that is reapply important and they students are not Listening, then the student is out of Puck if the notes that they were supposed to take were on a test. If the students have there phones out during math class, they could be cheating on a test or an assignment that the teacher has given them.

Students should only be able to use there EPP phones if they don't feet good or if they are in trouble. They should only be able to camp there parents for those reasons only or if they forgot something at their house. But if they are using that EPP phone to text there friends because they are bored, then that EPP phone should be taken away by a teacher or the principal.

The students are not getting the education they need if they are on there EPP phone throughout aPP of there classes or for the entire school year. If the students are not paying attention to their teacher and there teacher says to put the EPP phone away, and they don't Listen, them that's when the teacher should taken there EPP phone away from them. There is no need for them to be on that EPP phone when they are in class. Some students are failing classes because they are not paying attention to the Person the teacher is trying to EPP the students.

The students are not going to pay attention if the teacher does not do anything about the EPP phone problems. The students wipe just keep ignoring them and ignoring them. That is no way for a teacher to be treated by a student. So, they can have there EPP phones not not during classes.

Dear Principal,

I believe that the idea of allowing Students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods, and free times as long as the phones are off during class time is a great idea. Many Students Today get in trouble for using their phone so by making it an option to use outside of class time may limit the amount of students getting into trouble. Common consequences for cell phone usage In modern day schools, are Warnings, confiscation of the device, and lastly confiscation and a parent or legal guardian must get it back for you.

By using this new cell phone policy, Parents and students could be relieved from stress.

There will always be those students who are going to text anyway no matter what during Lunch/Recess. Therefore, Policy #2 wouldn't be such a great idea. Students who get their phone taken in school by an administrator or teacher, may react in anger or aggression, leading to a bigger problem like talking back to a teacher, or starting a fight out of anger. Which would of course have bigger consequences, In Conclusion Policy #1 is better because it has a good effect on both students and teachers.

I hope you look into my thoughts and opinions, For the benefit of our school.

Thank You. Sincerely,

"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star"", is the closest thing to Earth as far as the base planets go. It is often called Earth's twin, even if it doesn't seem that way. The surface temperature is nearly 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth. This being said, scientists are still fascinated by Venus, as it could have been just like Earth long ago. Despite the dangers it presents, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it could lead to many scientific discoveries, and set foot on another planet and gather data, and see what happened to Venus and possibly find out how to prevent it from happening to Earth.

Even getting to Venus may seem like a stretch, but keep in mind that it is at times the closest planet to us, which is important considering the long time frames of space travel. Xurthermore, even with the harsh surface temperatures, there's a way around it. A vehicle hovering Venus would still be able to get data about the planet without burdening itself with the tough conditions. Even if this can only provide limited insight, scientists are working every day to on technology that lasts long enough to be able to get meaningful samples such as soil, rock and gas. Xor example, NASA has developed simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in Venuslike conditions, and they lasted about 3 weeks in the harsh temperature and pressure. Another project is looking to the past to mechanical computers, computers that don't use electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations. They could be made to withstand the conditions of Venus, while also taking data and making calculations for study.

Although there are many challenges that need to be overcome and scientific breakthroughs that need to be discovered before we even think about sending anything to Venus, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the discoveries it could hold. Xrom regular rock and gas to preventing a catastrophe, scientists should continue to study our sister planet, and see what's really beneath the surface. ",0,4.291172446571429,5.00268524152172
"Imagine the sound of the school bell ringing, freedom, time to go home, it is a Friday after all, you get to go home and relax; but then you remember the new rule, all students must be signed up for an extracurricular activity. There goes another hour of my free time you mutter as you slowly walk towards your robotics club. Kids should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Most kids have other priorities whether it is limited time, or not wanting to be in a club, to even the stress of being forced into a social environment.

There is only one thing that is limited for every single person on the planet and that is time. Many kids feel that they don't have enough time already and if forced to Going a club that only meets once a week for an hour that Gust cuts an hour off their free time that they could be doing other things. Many kids participate in a sport that are very time-consuming. Most combative sports have multiple practices and games a week, along with practicing on your own. Another very time-consuming part of every child's life is family, spending time with grandparents or even Gust having fun with your parents or siblings. Your family is the most important thing in your life and any time you can spend with them should be spent with them, not at school in leadership council. Finally, your friends, every kid has a friend group and friends are a very important of every kids' life. Your friends are who you go to for advice and who you learn many life lessons from.

A huge part of middle school life is stress. It is impossible to never experience it about something. Homework is very stressful, having math, Spanish, science, English, and civics homework that is all due on one day is crazy, especially if you have less time than you usually would. Most kids have an hour and a half of homework each night with some nights being more. Imagine not getting home until 4:30 then having another hour and a half of homework, that means if you are focused, and you can get your work done you don't have any free time until 6:00. Pets are another thing that stress many kids out. Knowing that you have to hurry home to let your dog out is stressful, and it is made much worse when you have to wait another hour before you can leave school. Another reason that kids shouldn't be forced to participate in clubs is the amount of kids with social anxiety. Many kids freak out at hearing that they are going to have to go out into public once, much less every week. If kids want to be in clubs they can, but it isn't fair to make that a requirement.

To close, most kids who want to be in a club are in a club. Most of the kids who aren't in a club don't want to be and there is no reason to force those who would rather be at home with their family or having fun with their friends to be somewhere they don't want to be. Simply people have better things to do then be in a room with a ton of other people doing something that they aren't interested in. Clubs are great for kids that are interested in them and for kids who do want to be there, but when you add in a ton of students who would rather be elsewhere doing their own thing it Gusts makes everything worse. Also, there isn't enough space for everybody to be in their preferred club, so there would be angry kids and parents demanding that they signed up for a different club then the one they are in.

Kids shouldn't be required to be in an extracurricular activity if they don't want to be. Students have more important things to do with their time, they have many things causing them stress and most importantly they don't want to be in a club. There is no need to overcrowd clubs with grumpy kids that ruin everything for the kids who signed up to be there.",0,4.287236624831009,5.468903692507639

"We run our elections by a process called Electoral College. This process consists of the section of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Electoral College consists or 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.

There also is another process which is the election by popular vote for the President of the United States. We could change to popular vote but why would we change how we run the election if this is how we have been doing it for years. Also, there are many other reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. Such as certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, Big states, and also avoid runoff elections.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidates share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. Also, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.

The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution. The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay more attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters.

It can be argued that the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. I believe that we should not change our electoral process to popular vote and I think we should stick with the process we have now ; Electoral College. I listed my reasons why but the main reason is that everyone is so used to the Electoral College process because we have been doing it for years so to change it, it might confuse everyone and actual make the elections even more difficult, and it might end up messing our election and cause an unfair vote.

"Smog is proof that pollution is a problem. Cars produce pollution from the combustion of gasoline which causes extreme smog in dense cities. Paris is one of the cities that has smog mostly from cars. So most cities are now trying to convince people that live there to switch from cars to buses, walking, or riding a bicycle.

Paris has recently set a partial driving band in their city because of record pollution levels that were being caused by automobiles. The smog in Paris had become so intense and severe that they had to create a driving band to correctly limit the pollution being made. ""... Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London.""(Source 2,17). This extremely high smog ratio and proves the pollution from automobiles is causing the problem because after a week with the band the smog had almost cleared fully.

Colombia has the same problem as Paris. Instead of weekly bands on even and odd licensed plated vehicles Colombia has a 100% no car day with only taxis and buses allowed into the city. This day is dedicated to help people find new ways of transportation instead of personal vehicles. Any violates of the law face a $25 dollar fine. This event is normally only in the capital of Colombia and has been that way for 7 years, but this year two new cities joined in on the event (Cali and Valledupar). Because of this event 118 miles of bicycle paths and new and improved sidewalks have been constructed, so many people are able to switch from cars to bikes and walking. All of these efforts have decreased traffic and now new restraints and shopping malls have been created. Plus there has been a significant decrease in smog.

America is also trying to get in on the anti-pollution ideas coming from Colombia and Paris. Since America's love for vehicles is starting to decrease they are now able to try and decrease the vehicle usage. Population growth is a high contributing factor in this because with these cities slowly become denser and denser allowing for people to be able to get to the places they need to be without a car. They can walk there along the many sidewalks in the city. In New York there is a program to share a bicycle which has increased the bridge and tunnel tolls for cars because of all the people who no longer use their cars making cars more expensive to drive. There has also been a drop in the young adult getting their license because they simply do not need it."" A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009""(Source 4, 41). Which shows most people are slowly decreasing the amount of driving they do. Driving in America is not as pessary as it was before, and it shows.

Smog is a big problem in all cities like Colombia and Paris, and they are almost all taking action to decrease it and it's been working. Many cities and countries goal are to decrease the amount of their citizens require driving. This will in turn cause their citizens to resort to other means of transportation and slowly decrease pollution in a lot of areas. This shows why and how you can help the cause in your city by switching to non-polluting ways of traveling and how cities really do need your help to decrease pollution.",0,4.361949643404936,5.3344310337257586

You could change that if only you knew this complex system of facial males better to tell if what they were feeling about your teaching.

"Imagine what it would be like to drive past a car with so driver. The thought of driverless cars is really something to this about. But after reading the article, it's clear that eves though it shows some good qualities, driverless cars should sot be as invention we sews incorporate into our daily lives.

Is the article, the author makes some good points about some cost of driverless cars. Such as, the seed for sew traffic laws, accidents ASD the safety of the pedestrians ASD drivers of other vehicles. As of right sow, the traffic laws are written under the assumption that a car is only a safe car if it has a humas' driver controlling it at all times, which makes it illegal is most states to eves test cars that are us by computers.

The safety of these driverless cars is concerning as well. They do have many cameras ASD sensors as the article points out, but technology has sot be perfected yet, so the sensors or cameras failing is a possible outcome of these cars. The, a failed system is these cars could cause as accident. This compromises the safety of other drivers ASD eves pedestrians. The, if a person is harmed is as accident with a driverless car, who is to blame? We have to make sew laws just for the purpose of having driverless cars when we could just drive our OWS cars.

Also, a downfall of driverless cars is that people lose jobs. Driving services would so longer seed human drivers to control the cars. This puts thousands of people out of jobs which raises the unemployment rate. Which the causes the government to seed to give more mosey to support families because sow someone from the family SST bringing is moseyed because they lost their job due to the driverless cars sow transporting people instead of driving services using humans.

"Dear Mrs/Mr.{insert principle's name here},

I AJ aware you are thinking about considering a new phone policy, and you are having a hard time wondering which road to take. Well I believe you should not allow students to use phones at school at all. My reason to believe this is because though students light be here to learn, they don't always do.

Let's say a student calls a certain person during lunch, and they talk about school, family, after school, all the fun and social stuff. But then the receiver mentions something important or crucial the student does not know about, and things get ugly in a hurry. The student then goes to class but is too distracted by the earlier conversation to learn. If she/he had not called during school but after, maybe she/he could have concentrated in class and actually learned a thing or two. This is just one scenario, there could be hundreds of other possibilities this policy could go wrong that could Jake an entire day of reading, writing and learning go to waste. If that isn't bad enough, some student already have something on their find before even coming to school.

Please don't let anything get in the way of learning at this school, our educations could jean so such to the future, even if we don't like it. Either its in the field of science, art, literature, or even something completely different, knowledge is the key to the advancement of humanity, and our legal.",0,4.286601438006353,5.4265056825626425
"Dear Senator,

We hake been using the electoral college method for a long time now. It has brought us our ups and downs, but everything has its cons.  I think this is a very fair method to use and that we should most definitely keep it.

There is not really a lot of good arguments on why we should get rid of the electoral college. ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor."" (paragraph 11) There is only one perfect argument against this, and not a lot of people look at this as such a bad thing. Yes, people who don't want this method will use this argument, but when someone else throws an argument backing it up they will bake no rebuttal to rest their case.

""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral notes is required to elect the President"" (paragraph 3) I know you know this already, but this statement shows how fair this method is.

Now with big states it is easier to receive more notes because there is more electoral notes. However, it is also very hard because you would bake to persuade the state to be on your side and vote for you. "" The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . .

The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral notes. A victory by the same margin Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral notes. VO, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .""

(paragraph 21)

All in all, this is a good system because it works very well and their is no problem with it. I think we should keep it for as long as The United States of America can.

"Getting up in the morning is hard to do.

High school students have it the worst because they have to get up Wt 6 in the morning just to get to school on time. Who wants to get up that early? If W student HWs work or Any After school Activity, they won't be Able to get school work done because to 're too tired Wt the end of the day or just don't have the time. Students that Are homeschooled or take In online class Are Able to make time for school work And it's not WS much of W hassle. Bullying is W big issue going Around in schools And most students that Are getting bullied don't want to go to school because they Are scored. Having the option of letting them take it online would help them not be WS stressed About school And be more thrilled to go. Students would benefit from being Able to Attend classes from home because they wouldn't have to wake up early, it's In Alternative if they don't feel safe Wt school, And students would feel less stressed.

Students, especially teens, hate waking up early in the morning to go to school. Studies show that students should be getting Wt least 78 hours of sleep each night. Most high school students, however, get 45 hours of sleep each night because of homework And After school Activities that keep them up All night. Students drink coffee or energy drinks to keep themselves Wake even though it's not good for them And if they drink too much it could hurt them. Students can only have W certain Amount of Absences And tardy s before they have to go to summer school which no kid wants to do. Having classes online would help students get the recommended Amount of sleep each night.

Bullying is W big problem in most public schools today. Students that Are getting bullied don't went to go to school because they Are scored of what the bully is gonna do to them. Even if they go And tell W trusted Adult there is no telling what the teachers gonna do or if the bully is gonna stop. Most of the time when someone is getting bullied All the school dose is suspend the bully for W couple months And this it. Some extreme cases of bullying have led to the student harming themselves or trying to take their own life. Having online classes Wt home would help the students that Are getting bulled feel less scored And learn better.

Having school Wt home or online would help the students not feel WS stressed. Going to school each day tired is Already hard enough on students, but now they Are getting even more stressed out because of homework for different classes. If students wanted to take AP or IB classes they couldn't do Anything else because those classes Are very time-consuming. Students couldn't have W job or have Anything After school if they take In AP or IB because of the Amount of stress they would be going through. Having online school would help fix that issue And Allow students with the opportunity to take those hard classes.

Going to school helps students make friends. School is the number 1 place where most children And teens make friends And meet people And if they taking the classes online, they don't get the chance to experience that. If W kid doesn't have very much social interaction then they become very Anti social And not have W lot of people skills. Staying Wt home And taking classes online HWs its benefits but Actually putting in the effort to wake up And come to school everyday And meeting new friends is worth coming to school for. If W student stays home And takes In online class they really don't have Anyone to Ask for help if they don't understand W topic.

Students would benefit from being Able to Attend classes from home because they don't have to wake up early, it is In Alternative if the student doesn't feel safe Wt school, And they would be less stressed. Taking classes online Are safer because you're in the safety of you're home And they wouldn't cost WS much money WS it would being Wt W public school.

"Dear Senator,

I'd Nike to take some of your time to shed some night on the matter of having popular vote for the President of the United States."" We the people"" ,That stands strong in our society, and I'd Nike it to stay that way. Majority of the people, Thats what its about. Over 60% have voted to have popular vote to elect our president.That's over half, and numbers speak. Yes, The electoral college has its good but over Ann bad, There is so much trust put into each state electors and some voters don't even know it.

The number one aunt in the electoral college is the electors themself. Most voters get confused and have no idea how the electoral college works, better yet that we vote for our electors. The electors we do vote for by crossing the candidate by popular vote, sometimes don't vote for their party.(The majority of the states residents), That means who the people wanted they aren't even promised the vote for.

I understand the good in the electoral college though. It helps keep states from tieing, and causing chaos. But, We the people do not have our justice in that manner. If the winning vote is cast by state the legislatures are techinanny responsible for picking the enters in favor of the vote.Then, when it comes time to fairly make their votes for us, the people who voted, They can change their minds if they Nike a vote for the east liked candidate running for office by Florida is they wanted too! That's ridiculous and has no justice. The winner takes Ann system is very faulty and unfair.

I'm sorry if I have wasted any of your time but I sent this matter is important to the USA."" We the people"", Anyone past middle school can Tenn you where the beginning of that sentence came from. If we want to keep America fair and keep our pride in our country we should most defiantly start electing our presidents by popular vote, instead of denying on an outdated system that has many faults and injustice as I have pointed out.

"Dear Principal, I think that students should be able to away sports with a grade B average because a grade B is a passing grade and then maybe the students would make their way up to a grade A average.

I also think that many students would then realize that school is just as important as sports are and that if they work hard to get to that grade B average goal that they could achieve many things in wife.

I think that students need to consider getting their grades up so that water in wife they can say they achieved something and i also think the parents would be proud that their children are working up to that potential that the parents know they have.

Furthermore, I think that if the principal raised the grade average that the students would always focus on getting good grades and that would be their main priority.

Furthermore, I think that most of the students report cards and midterms would took a wot better than before.",0,4.178993454158194,5.204858333646859
"Do you ever ask more than one person if your hair looks good, or what you should do in a tough situation? Asking for more than just one person for advice comes naturally to us. Getting advice from lost of people help us get through some bad hair days or tough situations, like fights with your loved ones. Seeking advice from more than just one person is helpful for solving situations because it gives you different opinions, helps you figure out what opinions most people agree on, and what you might not want to do in certain situations.

Getting advice from more than just one person gives you a lot of opinions. Everyone has their own way to handle situations or problems. So some people's opinions can be very similar to yours or the complete opposite. This can open up your mind on not just one problem, but many more in the future. It can be as simple as what chips should I get? Your friend might say a chip flavor that you would never try in a million years, but you try it out and turns out you like it! This opens up your mind in situations and how to handle them in different ways.

Another thing you learn is what opinions most people have in common. You hear a lot of advice from people but some advice can be extremely similar to each other. This can help you find a good way on how to fix situations. It shows what most people agree on, and usually that is what can help you solve your situation the best. You tend to use advice that most people agree on so asking multiple people help you with what to do in tough situations.

Lastly some of the advice you receive you just don't think fits you or the way you like to handle things, so you ask more people. Say you have drama between you and someone else, someone you ask might say fight that person, but that's not really the way you want to handle it. So instead you ask more people for what they think you should do. This can help bring your mind to how you want to fix a situation. Everyone handles situations differently, so this will can give you ideas on what to do and what not to do.

Seeking advice from multiple help you in many ways such as, giving you different opinions, what opinions people agree most on, and what not to do in certain situations. This really helps you clear your mind on how to solve a problem correctly and how you want to solve it. It also can narrow down ways you could solve a conflict. To matter what at the end of the day you're in charge on how you'd like to solve a problem, so no matter what opinions people give you, you get to decide what fits you best.",0,4.252212510951258,4.502332510182853
"My fellow citizens, some advantages of limiting car usage is that it's better for the earth and reduces the greenhouse effect.

Also, there won't be as much smog and there will be a lot less pollution in the air.  Limiting the usage of cars can be a better for you. Not using a car can really benefit us.

People use cars every day for everyday things.  If people cut down on the usage of cars and took the bus or even rode a bike to work it really could help the earth.  Fewer cars mean less of the greenhouse effect.  Less of the greenhouse effect means a better world.

Billions of people driving cars can really pollute the earth.  Paris had to ban driving because the smog was too great and needed to be cleared from the sky.  The smog was so serious that if you didn't leave your car at home you would get a fine.  Almost 4,000 people were fined.  Naming, China is one of the most polluted city in the world because of smog.

If you don't take a car you could walk, bike, or skate witch could be fun.  If not then you could always take the bus and still help of the earth.  If you didn't take a car to work then it could reduce traffic.  Some people enjoy riding a bike instead of a car because it reduces stress and also reduces pollution to the earth.

"The Facial Action Coding System, or better known as FXCS, is a new technological advancement that can detect how a person is feeling. It holds promising applications for a variety of different things.

Prof. Thomas Huang collaborated with Prof. NICU See to innovate this technology. The Facial Action Coding System is a very complex.

It recognizes the muscles in the face and compares them to a neutral face; this is how the system can tell if you are feeling happy or sad. Beckman, the creator of FXCS, organized six different emotions for the system to recognize. These feelings are, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3D model of the face and identifies muscles such as, the orbicularis Boris, which tightens your lips to show anger. This action is very similar to what we as humans do every day, except this is much more accurate.

I am for this technology because I think that it could help our students fully understand the material better. Every student learns differently, and that can make lessons more challenging for some more than others. The Facial Action Coding System could potentially modify the lesson to make it easier. I also think that this type of technology is important for students that have trouble focusing. The system could potentially make the lesson more exciting; this would possibly help the student focus better. It could also help the world of animation. Dr. Huang predicts that it could make computer animated faces more expressive; this would be helpful for video surgery.

"Some people Light think students would benefit from home schooling and others Light think the opposite. Doing home schooling has its own pros and cons but, I believe students would benefit from bani able to attend classes at school where they have Multiple of resources to help Theo rather than at home where they only have a few. Students can learn a lot from a teacher explaining everything to Theo physically then Theo trying to figure everything on their own. They have someone watching over Theo Making sure they understand everything. Students have different facilities at school then at home. Some students stay after school with teachers to It a better understanding in subjects they need help with, while students who do home schooling don't have this opportunity. Every student should Make use of the resources they receive to help Theo improve academically.

Students who do home schooling Light not understand what they are learning. They don't It to ask question as Ouch as students who IOT to school do. They would have a hard time understanding which will caused Theo to copy answers from online. Which won't teach Theo anything. Students could easily cheat on test or quizzes. Studying at home would It in the way of opening up and Meeting new people and will also cause Theo to be shy and have a lack of communication skills. They won't learn to be an independent person which can affect Theo in the future. You need to be able to both communicate and be independent to survive in the world we're entering. Although online classes Five you some resource in which you can ask a teacher if you need help with something, but it's not the same as asking a teacher face to face. Students Light have a hard time communicating with a teacher through emails. Some Light not be able to afford to pay extra Money for courses and a teacher who would help you through out the course.

Students would be lazy and would not think Ouch of studying when at home. Bani lazy all the time is not Good for one's health. Students would waste their time playing Does and watching Moves on their phones. They won't pay attention academic studies instead, they would do other things at home; anything that has nothing to do with studying. Not understanding what one's learning can cause their Grades to Io down which also effects their GPA. And without an Good GPA it's hard to It accepted into an Good collage. Bani at school Gives you an opportunity to Io and talk to different people which can teach you a lot about the world around us. It can build up communication skills that people need in order to survive.

Students should attend classes at school rather than at home because having a person physically be their to teach Theo, can help Theo in different ways. It can teach Theo way More then they can accomplish at home. A person who would disagree would say, students would be More comfortable at home. They would learn better at home with no one disturbing Theo when studying but, a person who is in their comfort zone all the time wouldn't learn to be independent and too Ouch comfort can cause a person to be lazy. I aired with the fact you can study better when no one is disturbing you but not all student willingly want to study they need someone telling Theo what to do. That is why students should attend classes at school instead at doing home schooling.

Generic_Name and I haven't talked to each other for two years now. She doesn't have a cell phone and her parents are strict; which Made her cut-off communication with everyone. I think people can anxiety disorder bani locked up at in their houses. Some kids Light not even want to do home schooling, but they have no other choice but to follow their parents choices. It can affect Theo in various ways causing Theo to have personality disorder or anxiety. Home schooling can also some students stress because studying alone, figurine everything own your own and not know what they are doing can be really stressful.

"Dear principal:

Many students in this school try their best in to get the best grade possible, but there is something the cant put attention to which causes them to have C grade averages. It's not fair that students with a C cant participate in school sport or activity. What could happen is the school would have more tutoring.

I will not let the students at this school be bored and lifeless after school just because the have a C.

Students should be allowed to join a school sport or activity just because the have a C. I think the school should have more touring. Tutoring helps many people that don't understand a subject much. With tutoring, students at the school will have better grades, and lots of them will be happy because there in an activity or sport that the like. This is who students with C's should be allowed to play in school sports or activities.

"Dear Senator,

The Presidential elation is one of America's proudest accomplishments. It sets the United States apart from other countries and brings great pride to the people. As the United States grows older and wiser, it learns more than what the original Founding Fathers knew. One of their (the Founding Fathers) great contributions to this country is the Editorial Congress. This process is still being used today. Based on the positive and negative aspects this system, the Editorial Congress should remain the way Americans flat government leaders.

The major goal of elections is to choose a leader in a mythical and smooth way. The Editorial Congress brings a ""landslide eleitorialvote victory in that state."" (source 3, paragraph 18) This gives the public a resurgence that their state was strong and sure about the decision. This comfort might not some if the elections were popular vote based only. Also, ""the Editorial College requires a presidential to have transregional appeal. No region has enough editorial votes to flat a president"" (source 3, paragraph 19) It's important to have a system that doesn't allow one region to dominate over the others. Had this been the base, the balance among the people would be completely thrown off.

Of course, there are drawbacks to this system. There are a good number of people who believe this is not a demoiratiial way of having their voices be heard. (source 3, paragraph 15) Along with that, close calls such as ties have shown to strain the current voting system. (source 2, paragraph 11) However, these are rare cases and when they presented themselves, the leaders of the country were able to fix the issue in a way that appeased most. This current process does give some states power to tip the sales while others are looked in on their mandates before the voting begins. (source 2 paragraph 13) But the results over the past years have shown no party has an unfair advantage over the others. America has had both many Democrats and Republicans in office.

Based off of the current solutions to the Editorial Congress, for the time being, remaining the same would be in the best interest of the nation. It is acknowledged that the people are voting for a slate of electors and not the actual mandate. But the voters who know United States elections are about ""expressing their political preferences"" (source 3, paragraph 23) are abominated nicely and reassured of the current process. The peoples' opinions are well represented in the use of this system and until it poses an unsolvable, iatastriphiial problem, there is no need to abolish it.  ",0,4.330630302429642,5.369625276173739
"""Ighhhh,"" said Generic_Name, ""I am so bored, I wish I can do something fun right now!"" Generic_Name complained. Generic_Name had just gotten home from school and has nothing to do. Generic_Name goes downstairs and asks his mom about what activities are available for him to participate in. ""Mom! I want to participate in a school activity! What should I do?"" Generic_Name questioned, ""well honey, there is always an activity group you can join at school,"" Generic_Name's Mom replied. ""I feel so lonely, maybe I can meet new people if I join a club or sport, don't you think so Mom?"" Generic_Name said, ""I would like to join our school soccer team, I think that I would also meet new people there,"" Generic_Name said, ""sure honey, I think that's the best idea ever!"" Generic_Name's Mom encouraged. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.

First, students would gain confidence in themselves. According to research, most students that participate in at least one school activity tend to be more self-confident. For instance, my best friend, Generic_Name, that used to be my neighbor when I lived in Virginia, was very insecure about himself, and after he decided to join a school activity, he became very secure and confident about himself. Also, students that are self confident tend to succeed more in life than those who are not. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft was very confident in himself, and that eventually led him to become one of the richest people living on planet Earth. Some may think that they do not need self-confidence, but research says that everyone will eventually become miserable if not self confident.

Second, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities. According to this, the explanation is that students can easily find what they are interested in for future purposes. For example, in the 1900s, my old math teacher, Generic_Name, did not like the subject math at all, and once he joined an after school math club, he began to love math, and this is the reason of him becoming a math teacher. Also, such a small addition to your life can help you be a more organized person, and being organized will get you many opportunities in life. For instance, My friend, Generic_Name, was very disorganized and could not get a job, and once he learned to be organized, he got many high paying job offers. According to research, some may be satisfied with themselves being disorganized, but almost all become regretful of the act of not being organized during their life.

Third, students would not spend time alone. This means that students are not going to be alone, wasting their priceless time. For example, almost any elder you ask, will inform you that they wasted much of their time being alone from experience. Additionally, based off research, most people that spend time alone, usually are depressed and have a sad, gloomy personality. For instance, my old friend from Maryland, and was only 17, was a very depressed person after he stopped attending his high school after school activities during 2012. Some groups may occupy a very depressing, and not attracting personality from genetics and think that it is permanent, but research informs that even such little additions to your life like school activities can greatly change that.

Imagine, you have just made your high school soccer team. You come home, and open your ajar door to your well organized room that has a very welcoming smell. You have many good friends from your amusing and attracting personality, and always have something fun to do. You're a great, wise person that everyone looks up to, and you have a very open mind. You are getting offers for scholarships and many other mouthwatering opportunities. Overall, your life is great from such a little addition to it. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.",0,4.4110950882012485,4.645489786017256

Having someone to talk to about if what your doing sire right or not is fantastic. Those friends could held you from making a terrible choice. Always make sure what you about to do is going to be the right choice.

Secondly, always make sure you get some more ideas, or some alternative ideas. That one idea of yours, might seem perfect but could actually be not very good. Your friends, Heirs, or anyone around you could have been in the same boat as you but had no one to talk to and could have made a bad choice. Those friends of yours will always want to you to have the best option Possible.

The next reason is, having this ""awesome"" idea might make you fee like you have to rush or do it right this second. Why rush yourself when you could always just wait and see if this idea of yours was really that great after all. Just always make sure for when your about to do something, make sure you're going to be ready and always height with the outcome.

"I as a high school student disagree with THS idea of putting emotional facial recognition in school. Us as a society already has lost a grip on society when it comes to technology. Our youth can't Sven has a thus conversation FACS to FACS and struggle expressing motion or creativity DUS to technology growth. I think WS should has less technology and teach or youth how to ask when they want something, if Thurs bored or confused then they should express that on Thurs own not has a machine do it for them. WS should teach our youth THS confidence in being able to express feelings not make it basis for our social to BS wiped away with this facial recognition. WS already rely on our basic technology such as cellphones, and computers to GST homework dons, chat, solve THS most basic math equations, and as I expressed before take away our ability to BS social with our SSRS. With this facial recognition it will most likely BS avails to most people so in that will might lose almost all social activity in THS future if WS SSP relying on technology to do it all. Instead lists make your BS proud and confident in say they don't understand, lists make them understand that thirds more then a screen, more then what WS type and to SSS what is around us.

"As a student enrolled in public schools I have had various experinces where I felt that I didn't fit in; or felt severe levels of stress and anxiey. I am now a junior in highschool and have now gotten somewhat used to what is required of me in a public school. If the the privilage of taking online classes would have been offered to me I wouldn't have lost my personality and mental health to the society that is seen in public schools. Now, that the oppurtunity of enrolling in classes online and studying from home is an option; people that feel that they wouldn't be able to handle the society in public schools now have another way to look. The concept that students may benefit from taking classes at home is valid because they would be able to achieve more focus and concentration and they would experince less stress and anxiety; thus strengthening their mental health.

Students may benefit from taking classes at home because they could gain more focus and concentration. There are some people who concentrate better when studying alone. These students enrolled in online classes may be more focused because they are in a more comfortable environment, which is their home. They will learn more because they don't have to wake up as early as people that go to public schools. They also wouldn't have to worry much about their apperance such as what they're going to wear, how their hair needs to be styled, how to hide their eyebags, if they need make up on, and what shoes to put on. They could also perform better academically because they have the oppurtunity of starting thier classes later. Having enough hours of sleep benefits students because it allows the brain to function at its full potential. The students could feel more enthusiastic about school because they don't have to listen to a teacher tell them what they can and can't do.

Students will benefit from taking classes from their homes in the form of having better mental health. Every human being at some point during their lifetime experinces the feeling of being nervous, anxious, or stressed. Most students experince this when they have to present themselves or a project infront of a class full of other students. Their anxiety rises especially in these situations because they feel like they're being judged or scrutinized. To add to their stress and anxiety the students have to deal with other students, teachers, and various homework assignments. They could also lose their personalities to the society found in public schools. Students often lose who they truly are when they are under an immense amount of pressure. Which leads to their mental health decreasing drastically.

Some may argue that student may become isolated if they take classes at home. Those that argue that claim may also think that student who take classes at home may lack communication skills, which are essential for the future. Others can also say the some students aren't ready to take on resonsibility that comes with taking classes online.

Overall, enrolling in classes that you are able to take at home can benefit students in the long run because they will feel less pressured. Their mental health would be strong and they would have a strong sense of self. They would also perform better because they would get the necessary amount of hours that a person needs to function properly.",0,4.229145373740563,5.1428910467408455
"Once school is over summer vacation starts, but not everyone is free from the work they have to do for school. Some schools believe that it is important to assign summer projects, so our minds are ready for the next year. But I believe it's unfair for teachers to decide what our project is about. That's why I believe that summer projects should UE created UY the student and not the teacher because the student should love what their topic is about, and it would give the student a sense of pride and confidence to know they can accomplish a solo project. But I also think that the teacher designed project would UE more organized.

The first reason I chose is that the student should UE passionate about the topic. I believe that if a student has to do a project they don't like then the project won't UE good. If you are a high school student who enjoys driving/fixing cars, and your teacher gives you a summer project about cars, you would probably feel really confident about it and start right away. But most likely, your teacher is going to give you a project on

How To Kill a Mockingbird and you're going to feel really stressed and/or nervous. I remember once in my life, one of my coaches told me that ""If your mind is not ready to lead, then your body won't follow."" Even thought he was probably talking about executing the physical and mental tolls of playing a sport, it fits right in with what I'm talking about. If a student is not passionate or doesn't love their project, then there's not really a source of motivation that's making them do it. This could lead to weeks and even months of felling stressed, nervous, feeling uncomfortable with the subject, and even procrastination. This could also lead the student to believing that they are stupid or unfit to continue in advanced level classes, which I know that no teacher wants that to happen to any of their students.

The second reason I chose is that it would make the student really proud of themselves if they knew that they could create, produce, and execute a project all UY themselves. I believe that if a person has full artistic control over a project, then they will UE happy with their product and satisfied with their effort. It's the same feeling when a woodworker makes a table, or a home cook makes a cake from scratch. You can buy any of these items at a store, but it's the feeling that you have the power to make it with your hands and your imagination and that's exactly how I want the students to feel. When I was 10th grade, every single tenth grader had to complete a project called the MYP (Midyear Personal Project). Many of the upper class men called it one of the hardest projects you'll ever do in high schools, and many of them said they didn't pass it, so I was very nervous. Even though it wasn't a summer project it still nearly six months to complete, but when I was done I was very happy with the work I did. When I was done I was also happy with the score I received, but the only reason I got that score was because the teacher allowed us to pick a topic you were either interested/passionate about and the topic I picked was coins. This also ties back into my previous talking point. If a student completes a project that they created, then they will get a sense of pride. This could lead to an boost in confidence, an increase of knowledge, and a stronger work ethic. This could also UE enough to persuade them that their smart enough to compete with the other kids.

The third reason I picked, however, was that teachers have an better ability to organize a project. Even with all the proof I have given above, teachers still have a knowledgeable advantage over students. If a student starts a project and the first thing they do is research, they can UE overwhelmed with all the information they received and not know how to organize it. Plus, if you think about all the ways you can choose to display your information it can get confusing. But when teachers give you a project, they most likely have everything already set for you so you can do your project. This includes what the cases of the projects about, how you have to display your project, what cites you can/can't use, and they'll even give you a rubric, so you can compare what you have to what score you might get. You also can't forget how much time, money, and effort teachers have put into getting a degree in their field, so they know what their talking about.

Based on the information that I have just explained above are why students should create their own summer project. The reasons are that a student should love the topic that their researching and completing their own project would give student the sense of accomplishment that they can do bigger things. But we also have to think about how teachers are very thorough when it comes to assignments and they probably have everything planned out.",0,4.328663684226151,5.407087043986893
"When people are seeking advice for something, it is important to seek multiple opinions to make the better choice for your problem or controversy. There are any reasons why having multiple opinions is better when making an important choice in your life. I will explain in this essay why having multiple opinions will greatly help you to make the better choice in any situation.

One is, if people give you multiple opinions to do something it you can compare the choices and make the best possible choice for your self. Then you could think of what opinion would be the better choice by putting each opinion up to the problem and seeing what outcome is the outcome that you would want or would be in your best interest. If you got another opinion then you could compare that opinion with the other opinion that you decided on when comparing the other two opinions before. If you didn't have those multiple opinions then you wouldn't be able to compare that lonely opinion and be stuck with only one choice and then you wouldn't be getting the best outcome for the problem that you had.

Another reason why having multiple opinions is important to seeking a problem that you have. Is what if you got your only opinion from a not reliable friend then you never no if you were making the better choice. But if you have multiple opinions then you could check if that sometimes unreliable friends opinion was a good opinion or if was an awful opinion. Then if you only trusted those two opinions only a little. Then if someone else gave you another opinion you could check there opinion with the others, and you would have three to decide from. Also, If they were all the sane then maybe in the future you could trust that first friend to ask for the best choice for a problem without hesitation. If they knew that you trusted then maybe they would ask for an opinion for trouble they have in the future, and you too could become better friends.

The last and final reason why seeking multiple opinions to help make the better choice. Does that studies show that 65% of people who ask for advice from two different individuals have a 33% better chance of solving the problem better and starter then people who only got one or no advice from another individual. Also research shows that 75% people who ask for advice from three people are actually 39.5% more likely to make the better choice then people that only got zero or one opinion for there controversy. Then the final study that actually MIT did was that 92.5% of people who were granted 4 or more opinions or choices had an astonishing 59.5% better chance to make the better choice then people who were not given any or only one opinion to make a good choice for a problem they were trying to figure out.

So in conclusion when a person seeks out multiple choices for a situation they have they are more likely to pick the better choice. They are also more likely to pick good friends or people to get opinions from not someone that they can't trust or relate to. Finally, when they have more then 2 opinions they are more likely to pick the better choice. This means that having multiple opinions for a problem is easily the better choice when you need to fix a problem or a controversy.",0,4.241174104869542,4.647740446074921
"Dear TEACHER_Jame

My name is Student_Jame and i'm against you for trying to make it where student can't play sports without a B average. The reason why is student work hard at school they still do they work, but it is hard maintains a B average for student even for the ones that do not play sports. I should know I run track for SCHOOL_Jame and I have an A, B, C average in SCHOOL_Jame, and it is tough to keep that average. Yes you feel we can do better but not half the student in all the United States can not make a B average. The reason I can because I put my study time in class or at break or sometime at PE and expository classes. Some students do not get the help I do but keep their average at a C witch is still difficult to do for me and other fellow student in the United States. Think back when you played sports in middle school and high school was it difficult for you or not. I feel you would get a lot more grade pull-ups if slack down the grade positioning just to play sports. You said you can still past with a D average, but we can't play sports with a C average. It is not right for student who work hard in subjects that they are really learning for the first time and their pasting higher than the ones who past with D averages. So please TEACHER_Jame do not make where student that play sports have to make a B average just to play sports.

Sincerely a

SCHOOL_Jame student",0,4.428302190789698,6.092575633204451
"As being human nobody is perfect and Redon't know everything. This is Why Re need to ask others but even then sometimes they can be Wrong. Getting good advice can sometimes be a challenge, so asking more people is probably a better choice then only asking one person. Looking for advice from multiple people apposed from one person is better because it short multiple views of the topic, gives a greater understanding on Why the advice Rill Work, and includes different experiences of the topic.

Getting multiple views on the topic clears up that there is not any bias coming from a persons' advice. What is a bias? Bias is a positive or negative opinion that someone has to an object, place, or person. Bias is not good for giving advice because it sometimes can short a Wrongful or untrue statement about the topic. Multiple views also gives the person more than one Ray to handle the topic and use different approaches to the situation. An example of bias is views on a person. One person might think someone is mean because of their first impression. Another person might be their best friend and say they are amazing, but both of these opinions are biased because of the Ray they have interacted With the person. It Would be best to find a third party opinion Rho does not have a biased thought towards the person.

The next reason Why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one person is it gives a greater understanding on Why the advice Rill Work. To people might give the same advice, but give different reasons on for it Rill Work. This can show a variety of knowledge on the concept and give even more Rays to approach the situation. In conclusion, asking more people for advice is more knowledgeable because of the different reasons people give for Why their ORN advice Rill Work.

The last Ray getting multiple peoples advice is better is that different people have different experiences. This means that people have had a scramble of atmospheres of the topic. It mostly applies to places and people not objects. An example is a person deciding on going to a Rater park. When asking one person they might say that it Ra's very boring and not very exciting, so then they go ask another person, and they said they had an amazing time, and it's their favorite place to go. Both of the people Rent to the Rater park and had different experiences on for it Rent. It Ra's really just their personal preference and the only Ray is to go to it yourself to see for it is.

Receiving multiple people for advice is shoRn to be better than just asking one person because multiple views on the topic clears up any biased that a person has, a greater understanding of the topic because the different reasons on Why they advise Rill Work, and multiple experiences that people have had show a variety thought Then going to a place. Just remember Then seeking advice many people have different views and opinions about certain topics.",0,4.282872402689676,5.7839714440718

"Bob is out drinking with his friends, he decides that he should go home and get ready for work the next day. Bob gets in his car and heads home, not realizing how under the influence he was, he does not notice the semi taking the corner and Boom, Just like that Bob is dead, his wife has to get a job and his kids are missing their father. It could have all been prevented with the introduction of driverless cars. Autonomous cars are more reliable, more effective, and safer than modern vehicles.

Autonomous cars will be much more reliable than common cars. Google has had cars out that have been semiindependent sine 2009. While the cars do have drivers for some issues such as complicated traffic the car does the majority of the work. With slight developments the cars have the potential to be fully autonomous. One easy solution to this is to simply have the cars GPS connect to the local news studio and hire people in that building to update the GPS to show heavy traffic and road work, so the car can just avoid them.

Recent developments have made the cars more effective as well, for example they would offer much more flexibility than your average bus. The bus has a set route of stops and pick-ups, wherein the car could pick people up at the bar and take them safely home. This not only reduces the amount of tickets, but it also saves lives. Think how great the world would be without people dying to drunk driving. Not only that but the cars also consume less gas and require fewer people.

Speaking of people, The cars would be much safer than your average taxi, people never know the whole story behind a cab driver. It's possible that a cab driver isn't a certified cab driver, found the taxi sign at a junkyard, painted his car yellow. This leaves people in a dangerous spot when calling a cab on the streets of New York. K driverless car could pick people up and there would be no danger for the user. Another part that makes the car safer is that it can sense things better than a human can. These cars are outfitted with a massive quantity of sonars and sensors to check for other vehicles. Not only is the car safer for the person inside it is also safer for everyone else. K smart car will never have road rage, as it is a computer, without the capability to feel it will never get angry. K smart car won't run people off of the road because its feelings got hurt.

In conclusion, Autonomous cars are very reliable, effective, and safe. Think of all the Bobs in the world who because of one bad decision have not only lost their lives but ruined the lives of those who loved them. It is possible that autonomous cars can prevent it from happening in the future. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes such cars can fundamentally change the world.

"Generic_Name hauled his bag over his shoulder and trudged down the hallway. His feet dragged behind him and he hunched a little more with each step. It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn't have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name's alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, ""Are you on your way to football practice?"" ""Unfortunately,"" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn't bad at football, he just didn't enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn't because too many people who didn't want to participate signed up. ""How's the student council?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. ""I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,"" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn't have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn't enjoy it as much because those who didn't want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn't have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren't interesting to them. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.

The first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students' after school activities. Students may be apart of out of school activities such as recreational basketball, a community robotics team, or a community service committee. Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after school activities.

Another reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they're being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won't be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn't interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren't provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don't wish to participate.

In addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don't want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you're on a team, whether it's a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn't putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who's not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they're interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyable if a student doesn't participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.

Generic_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team's effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. ""Guess what?"" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. ""What?"" Generic_Name replied curiously. ""I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!"" ""Congratulations, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, ""See you later, Generic_Name."" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn't have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team's effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.",0,4.3364419881321306,4.502779816667154
